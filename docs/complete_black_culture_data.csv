Ancient Egypt,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt,"Ancient Egypt was a cradle of civilization concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in Northeast Africa. It emerged from prehistoric Egypt around  BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology), when Upper and Lower Egypt were amalgamated by Menes, who is believed by the majority of Egyptologists to have been the same person as Narmer. The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by the ""Intermediate Periods"" of relative instability. These stable kingdoms existed in one of three periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age; the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age; or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. The pinnacle of ancient Egyptian power was achieved during the New Kingdom, which extended its rule to much of Nubia and a considerable portion of the Levant. After this period, Egypt entered an era of slow decline. Over the course of its history, it was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign civilizations, including the Hyksos, the Kushites, the Assyrians, the Persians, and, most notably, the Greeks and then the Romans. The end of ancient Egypt is variously defined as occurring with the end of the Late Period during the Wars of Alexander the Great in  BC or with the end of the Greek-ruled Ptolemaic Kingdom during the Roman conquest of Egypt in  BC. In AD , the Arab conquest of Egypt brought an end to the region's millennium-long Greco-Roman period. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the Nile's conditions for agriculture. The predictable flooding of the Nile and controlled irrigation of its fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and thereby substantial social and cultural development. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored the mineral exploitation of the valley and its surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective constructi",Ancient Egypt | Bronze Age civilizations | Cradle of civilization | Former empires in Africa | Former empires in Asia,2025-06-22 19:38:04
Kingdom of Kush,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush,"The Kingdom of Kush (/kʊʃ, kʌʃ/; Egyptian: 𓎡𓄿𓈙𓈉 kꜣš, Assyrian:  Kûsi, in LXX Χους or Αἰθιοπία; Coptic: ⲉϭⲱϣ Ecōš; Hebrew: כּוּשׁ Kūš), also known as the Kushite Empire, or simply Kush, was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, centered along the Nile Valley in what is now northern Sudan and southern Egypt. The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization, producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry. The city-state of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between  and  BC, controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts, an area as large as Egypt. The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as ""Kush"" probably from the indigenous ethnonym ""Kasu"", over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare, trade, and cultural exchange. Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period (– BC). Following Egypt's disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata (now modern Karima, Sudan). Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt, such as the veneration of Amun, and the royal families of both kingdoms occasionally intermarried, Kushite culture, language and ethnicity was distinct; Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress, appearance, and even method of transportation. In the th century BC, King Kashta (""the Kushite"") peacefully became King of Upper Egypt, while his daughter, Amenirdis, was appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun in Thebes. His successor Piye invaded Lower Egypt, establishing the Kushite-ruled Twenty-fifth Dynasty. Piye's daughter, Shepenupet II, was also appointed Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The monarchs of Kush ruled Egypt for over a century until the Assyrian conquest, being dethroned by the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal in the mid-seventh century BC. Following the severing of ties with Egypt, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Meroë, during which ",Kingdom of Kush | States and territories disestablished in the 4th century | States and territories established in the 11th century BC | 350s disestablishments | Roman client kingdoms,2025-06-22 19:38:05
Nubia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia,"Nubia (/ˈnjuːbiə/, Nobiin: Nobīn, Arabic: النُوبَة, romanized: an-Nūba) is a region along the Nile river encompassing the area between the confluence of the Blue and White Niles (in Khartoum in central Sudan), and the first cataract of the Nile (south of Aswan in southern Egypt) or more strictly, Al Dabbah. It was the seat of one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, the Kerma culture, which lasted from around  BC until its conquest by the New Kingdom of Egypt under Pharaoh Thutmose I around  BC, whose heirs ruled most of Nubia for the next  years. Nubia was home to several empires, most prominently the Kingdom of Kush, which conquered Egypt in the eighth century BC during the reign of Piye and ruled the country as its th Dynasty. From the rd century BC to rd century AD, northern Nubia was invaded and annexed to Egypt, ruled by the Greeks and Romans. This territory was known in the Greco-Roman world as Dodekaschoinos. Kush's collapse in the fourth century AD was preceded by an invasion from the Ethiopian Kingdom of Aksum and the rise of three Christian kingdoms: Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. Makuria and Alodia lasted for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline started not only the partition of Nubia, which was split into the northern half conquered by the Ottomans and the southern half by the Sennar sultanate, in the sixteenth century, but also a rapid Islamization and partial Arabization of the Nubian people. Nubia was reunited with the Khedivate of Egypt in the nineteenth century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan. The primarily archaeological science dealing with ancient Nubia is called Nubiology. Historically, the people of Nubia spoke at least two varieties of Nubian languages, a subfamily that includes Nobiin (the descendant of Old Nubian), Dongolawi, Midob and several related varieties in the northern part of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan.

African empires,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_empires,"There were many kingdoms and empires in all regions of the continent of Africa throughout history. A kingdom is a state with a king or queen as its head. An empire is a political unit made up of several territories, military outposts, and peoples, ""usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant centre and subordinate peripheries"". In Africa states emerged in a process covering many generations and centuries. Most states were created through conquest or the borrowing and assimilation of ideas and institutions, while some developed through internal, largely isolated development. Economic development ""gave rise to a perceived need for centralized institutions and 'territorial' leadership that transcended older bonds of kinship and community"". The politicoreligious struggle between the people and the king sometimes saw the people victorious and the establishment of sacred kings with little political power (termed ""adverse sacralisation""), contrasted with divine kings equated to gods. Kings and queens used both 'instrumental power', the employment of direct influence to achieve a desired outcome, and 'creative power', the use of ritual and mythology.a: – Despite this, popular understanding often claims that the continent lacked large states or meaningful complex political organisation. Whether rooted in ignorance, Eurocentrism, or racism, famous historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper have argued that African history is not characterised by state formation or hierarchical structures. In fact, the nature of political organisation varied greatly across the continent, from the expansive West Sudanic empires, to the sacral Congolese empires akin to confederations or commonwealths, and the immensely hierarchical kingdoms of the Great Lakes. The vast majority of states included in this list existed prior to the Scramble for Africa (c. –) when, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, European powers rapidly invaded, conquered, and colonised Africa.

It was settled from  AD, and served as the capital of the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe from the th century. It is the largest stone structure in precolonial Southern Africa. Major construction on the city began in the th century until the th century, and it was abandoned in the th or th century. The edifices were erected by ancestors of the Shona people, currently located in Zimbabwe and nearby countries.

The Zimbabwe state centred on it likely covered , km (, sq mi). It is recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The site of Great Zimbabwe is composed of the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex, and the Great Enclosure (constructed at different times), and contained area for commoner housing within the perimeter walls.

Emerging from the earlier Dʿmt civilization, the kingdom was founded in the first century. The city of Axum served as the kingdom's capital for many centuries until it relocated to Kubar in the ninth century due to declining trade connections and recurring invasions. The Kingdom of Aksum was considered one of the four great powers of the third century by the Persian prophet Mani, alongside Persia, Rome, and China. Aksum continued to expand under the reign of Gedara (c. –), who was the first king to be involved in South Arabian affairs. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihama, Najran, al-Ma'afir, Zafar (until c. ), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands until a joint Himyarite-Sabean alliance pushed them out. Aksum-Himyar conflicts persisted throughout the third century. During the reign of Endubis (–), Aksum began minting coins that have been excavated as far away as Caesarea and southern India. As the kingdom became a major power on the trade route between Rome and India and gained a monopoly of Indian Ocean trade, it entered the Greco-Roman cultural sphere. Due to its ties with the Greco-Roman world, Aksum adopted Christianity as its state religion in the mid-fourth century under Ezana (s – c. ). Following their Christianization, the Aksumites ceased construction of steles. The kingdom continued to expand throughout late antiquity, conquering Kush under Ezana in  for a short period of time and inheriting from it the Greek exonym ""Ethiopia"".

The revolution was the only known slave uprising in human history that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery (though not from forced labour) and ruled by non-whites and former captives. The revolt began on  August , and ended in  with the former colony's independence. It involved black, biracial, French, Spanish, British, and Polish participants—with the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture emerging as Haiti's most prominent general. The successful revolution was a defining moment in the history of the Atlantic World and the revolution's effects on the institution of slavery were felt throughout the Americas. The end of French rule and the abolition of slavery in the former colony was followed by a successful defense of the freedoms the former slaves had won, and with the collaboration of already free people of color, of their independence from white Europeans. The revolution was the largest slave uprising since Spartacus' unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly , years earlier, and challenged long-held European beliefs about alleged black inferiority and about slaves' ability to achieve and maintain their own freedom.

As a revolutionary leader, Louverture displayed military and political acumen that helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. Along with Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Louverture is now known as one of the ""Fathers of Haiti"". Toussaint Louverture was born as a slave in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as Haiti. He was a devout Catholic, and was manumitted as an affranchi (ex-slave) before the French Revolution, identifying as a Creole for the greater part of his life. During his time as an affranchi, he became a salaried employee, an overseer of his former master's plantation, and later became a wealthy slave owner himself; Toussaint Louverture owned several coffee plantations at Petit Cormier, Grande Rivière, and Ennery. At the start of the Haitian revolution he was nearly  years old and began his military career as a lieutenant to Georges Biassou, an early leader of the  War for Freedom in Saint-Domingue. Initially allied with the Spaniards of neighboring Santo Domingo, Louverture switched his allegiance to the French when the new Republican government abolished slavery. Louverture gradually established control over the whole island and used his political and military influence to gain dominance over his rivals.

The western portion of the island of Hispaniola, where Haiti is situated, was inhabited by the Taíno and Arawakan people, who called their island Ayiti. The island was promptly claimed for the Spanish Crown, where it was named La Isla Española (""the Spanish Island""), later Latinized to Hispaniola. By the early th century, the French had built a settlement on the west of Hispaniola and called it Saint-Domingue.

After the war which had disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In , it exported indigo, cotton and  million pounds of raw sugar. By the end of the century, the colony encompassed a third of the entire Atlantic slave trade. In , slaves staged a revolt which led to the Haitian Revolution.

Europeans engaged in forced labor of the native population until that community was  decimated by disease. To replace the diminished native labor, enslaved Africans began being imported in earnest during the th century. By the early th century the Saint-Domingue (modern day Haiti) was a slave society with the majority of the population enslaved. In response to the conditions of slavery, the ideals of the French Revolution, and the disproportion amount of enslaved to free people, Haiti was the site of a slave revolt that became the Haitian Revolution. Slavery was abolished during the revolution but afterwards forced labor was brought back by some leaders, believing a plantation-style economy was the only way for Haiti to succeed. Unpaid labor is still widely practiced in Haiti. As many as half a million children are unpaid domestic servants called restavek, who routinely suffer physical and sexual abuse. Additionally, human trafficking, including child trafficking, and sex trafficking are significant problems in Haiti, in particular impacting people migrating to the Dominican Republic.

History of Jamaica,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jamaica,"The Caribbean Island of Jamaica was initially inhabited in approximately  AD or  AD by the Redware people, often associated with redware pottery. By roughly  AD, a second wave of inhabitants occurred by the Arawak tribes, including the Tainos, prior to the arrival of Columbus in . Early inhabitants of Jamaica named the land ""Xaymaca"", meaning ""land of wood and water"". The Spanish enslaved the Arawak, who were ravaged further by diseases that the Spanish brought with them. Early historians believe that by , the Arawak-speaking Taino tribes were extinct. However, some of the Taino escaped into the forested mountains of the interior, where they mixed with runaway African slaves, and survived free from first Spanish, and then English, rule. The Spanish also captured and transported hundreds of West African people to the island for the purpose of slavery. However, the majority of Africans were brought into Jamaica by the English. In , the English invaded Jamaica, and defeated the Spanish. Some African enslaved people took advantage of the political turmoil and escaped to the island's interior mountains, forming independent communities which became known as the Maroons. Meanwhile, on the coast, the English built the settlement of Port Royal, a base of operations where piracy flourished as so many European rebels had been rejected from their countries to serve sentences on the seas. Captain Henry Morgan, a Welsh plantation owner and privateer, raided settlements and shipping bases from Port Royal, earning him his reputation as one of the richest pirates in the Caribbean.",History of Jamaica | Spanish West Indies,2025-06-22 19:38:19

Reggae,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae,"Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/ ⓘ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica during the late s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A  single by Toots and the Maytals, ""Do the Reggay"", was the first popular song to use the word reggae, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. Reggae is rooted in traditional Jamaican Kumina, Pukkumina, Revival Zion, Nyabinghi, and burru drumming. Jamaican reggae music evolved out of the earlier genres mento, ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing), calypso, and also draws influence from traditional African folk rhythms. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower-paced than both ska and rocksteady. The concept of call and response can be found throughout reggae music. The genre of reggae music is led by the drum and bass. Some key players in this sound are Jackie Jackson from Toots and the Maytals, Carlton Barrett from Bob Marley and the Wailers, Lloyd Brevett from the Skatalites, Paul Douglas from Toots and the Maytals, Lloyd Knibb from the Skatalites, Winston Grennan, Sly Dunbar, and Anthony ""Benbow"" Creary from the Upsetters.

Rastafari,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari,"Rastafari is an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the s. It is classified as both a new religious movement and a social movement by scholars of religion. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas. Rastafari beliefs are based on an interpretation of the Bible. Central to the religion is a monotheistic belief in a single God, referred to as Jah, who partially resides within each individual. Rastas accord key importance to Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia between  and , who is regarded variously as the Second Coming of Jesus, Jah incarnate, or a human prophet. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or ""Babylon"". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the Promised Land, or ""Zion"". Rastas refer to their practices as ""livity"", which includes adhering to Ital dietary requirements, wearing their hair in dreadlocks, and following patriarchal gender roles. Communal meetings are known as ""groundations"", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the smoking of cannabis, the latter regarded as a sacrament with beneficial properties. Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised Afro-Jamaican communities in s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant British colonial culture. It was influenced by both Ethiopianism and the Back-to-Africa movement promoted by black nationalist figures such as Marcus Garvey. The religion developed after several Protestant Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in  fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the s, Rastafari's countercultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clash",Rastafari | Abrahamic religions | Afro-Caribbean religion | Cannabis and religion | Cultural depictions of Haile Selassie,2025-06-22 19:38:23
Marcus Garvey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey,"Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. ONH ( August  –  June ) was a Jamaican political activist. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) (commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Garvey was ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist. His ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born into a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay and was apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism. He later lived briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. On returning to Jamaica, he founded the UNIA in . In , he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule in Africa and advocated the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that part of the diaspora should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular, and the UNIA grew in membership. His black separatist views—and his relationship with white racists like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the interest of advancing their shared goal of racial separatism—caused a division between Garvey and other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who promoted racial integration. Believing that black people needed to be financially independent from white-dominated societies, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negro World newspaper.

Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off-time to musical accompaniment. It also differs from singing, which varies in pitch and does not always include words. Because they do not rely on pitch inflection, some rap artists may play with timbre or other vocal qualities.

Precursors to modern rap music include the West African griot tradition, certain vocal styles of blues and jazz, an African-American insult game called playing the dozens (see Battle rap and Diss), and s African-American poetry. Stemming from the hip-hop cultural movement, rap music originated in the Bronx, New York City, in the early s and became part of popular music later that decade. Rapping developed from the announcements made over the microphone at parties by DJs and MCs, evolving into more complex lyrical performances.

Much less commonly a rapper can decide to perform a cappella, meaning without accompaniment of any sort.

Two weeks later, his second album, Life After Death (), was issued as a posthumous double album; it debuted atop the Billboard , yielded two Billboard Hot -number one singles: ""Hypnotize"" and ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" (featuring Puff Daddy and Mase), and received dia",The Notorious B.I.G. | 1972 births | 1997 deaths | 1997 murders in the United States | 20th-century American male musicians,2025-06-22 19:38:41

Jazz,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz,"Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late th and early th centuries. Its roots are in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The mid-s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz fusion appeared in the late s and early s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smoot",Jazz | African-American cultural history | African-American music | American styles of music | Jazz terminology,2025-06-22 19:38:50
Blues,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues,"Blues is a music genre and musical form that originated among African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the s.  Blues has incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads from the African-American culture. The blues form is ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale, and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or ""worried notes""), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. Blues music is characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the th century that the most common current structure became standard: the AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African Americans. Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the music of Africa. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the African-American community, the spirituals. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery, with the development of juke joints occurring later. It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the th century. The first publication of blues sheet music was in .

With Strayhorn, he composed multiple extended compositions, or suites, as well as many short pieces. For a few years at the beginning of Strayhorn's involvement, Ellington's orchestra featured bassist Jimmy Blanton and tenor saxophonist Ben Webster, and reached what many claim to be a creative peak for the group.

Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals.

Soul music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music,"Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in African-American communities throughout the United States in the late s and early s. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body movements, are an important hallmark of soul. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead and backing vocalists,  an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music is known for reflecting African-American identity and stressing the importance of African-American culture. Soul has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues, and primarily combines elements of gospel, R&B and jazz.  The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in its  proliferation during the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It had a resurgence in the mid-to late s with the subgenre neo soul, which incorporated modern production elements and hip hop influences. Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B charts in the s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere.

Rhythm and blues,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues,"Rhythm and blues, frequently abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated within African American communities in the s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when ""rocking, jazz based music ... with a heavy, insistent beat"" was starting to become more popular.
In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the s through the s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations. The term ""rhythm and blues"" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early s, it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term ""R&B"" became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music.

African-American culture,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture,"African-American culture, also known as Black American culture or Black culture in American English, refers to the cultural expressions of African Americans, either as part of or distinct from mainstream American culture. African-American/Black-American culture has been influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole. Black-American/African American culture primarily refers to the distinct cultural expressions, traditions, and contributions of people who are descendants of those enslaved in the United States, as well as free people of color who lived in the country before . This culture is rooted in a specific ethnic group and is separate from the cultures of more recent melanated (dark-skinned) immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, or Afro-Latinos. African American culture is not simply defined by race or historical struggle but is deeply rooted in shared practices, identity, and community. African American culture encompasses many aspects, including spiritual beliefs, social customs, lifestyles, and worldviews. When blended together these have allowed African Americans to create successes and excel in the areas of literature, media, cinema, music, architecture, art, politics, and business, as well as cuisine marriage, and family. A relatively unknown aspect of African American culture is the significant impact it has had on both science and industry. Some elements of African American culture come from within the community, others from the interaction of African Americans with the wider diaspora of people of African origin displaced throughout the th and th centuries, and others still from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community. In addition, African American culture is influenced by Indigenous African Culture, and Native American culture.citation needed",African-American cultural history | African-American society | Culture of the Southern United States,2025-06-22 19:39:50
Harlem Renaissance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance,"The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual and cultural revival of African-American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theater, politics, and scholarship centered in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, spanning the s and s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after The New Negro, a  anthology edited by Alain Locke. The movement also included the new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeastern United States and the Midwestern United States affected by a renewed militancy in the general struggle for civil rights, combined with the Great Migration of African-American workers fleeing the racist conditions of the Jim Crow Deep South, as Harlem was the final destination of the largest number of those who migrated north. Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood, many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris, France, were also influenced by the movement.  Harlem had also seen significant Black immigration from British, French and other colonies in the Caribbean. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, took place between —when Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance—and , the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African-American arts, and many of it ideas and forms influenced society and thought in the following decades. Until the end of the Civil War, the majority of African Americans had been enslaved and lived in the South. During the Reconstruction Era, the emancipated African Americans began to strive for civic participation, political equality, and economic and cultural self-determination. Soon after the end of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan Act of  gave rise to speeches by African-American congressmen",Harlem Renaissance | 20th-century American literature | 1910s in Manhattan | 1920s in Manhattan | 1930s in Manhattan,2025-06-22 19:39:51
Black Panther Party,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party,"The Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) was a Marxist–Leninist and black power political organization founded by college students Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in October  in Oakland, California. The party was active in the United States between  and , with chapters in many major American cities, including San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Philadelphia. They were also active in many prisons and had international chapters in the United Kingdom and Algeria. Upon its inception, the party's core practice was its open carry patrols (""copwatching"") designed to challenge the excessive force and misconduct of the Oakland Police Department. From  onward, the party created social programs, including the Free Breakfast for Children Programs, education programs, and community health clinics. The Black Panther Party advocated for class struggle, claiming to represent the proletarian vanguard. In , J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), described the party as ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country."" The FBI sabotaged the party with an illegal and covert counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) of surveillance, infiltration, perjury, and police harassment, all designed to undermine and criminalize the party. The FBI was involved in the  assassinations of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, who were killed in a raid by the Chicago Police Department. Black Panther Party members were involved in many fatal firefights with police. Huey Newton allegedly killed officer John Frey in , and Eldridge Cleaver (Minister of Information) led an ambush in  of Oakland police officers, in which two officers were wounded and Panther treasurer Bobby Hutton was killed.

Nation of Islam,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam,"The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a religious organization founded in the United States by Wallace Fard Muhammad in . A centralized and hierarchical organization, the NOI is committed to black nationalism and focuses its attention on the African diaspora, especially on African Americans. While describing itself as Islamic and using Islamic terminology, its religious tenets differ substantially from orthodox Islamic traditions. Scholars of religion characterize it as a new religious movement. The Nation teaches that there has been a succession of mortal gods, each a black man named Allah, of whom Fard Muhammad is the most recent. It claims that the first Allah created the earliest humans, the Arabic-speaking, dark-skinned Tribe of Shabazz, whose members possessed inner divinity and from whom all people of color descend. It maintains that a scientist named Yakub then created the white race. The whites lacked inner divinity, and were intrinsically violent; they overthrew the Tribe of Shabazz and achieved global dominance. Setting itself against the white-dominated society of the United States, the NOI campaigns for the creation of an independent African-American nation-state, and calls for African Americans to be economically self-sufficient and separatist. A millenarian tradition, it maintains that Fard Muhammad will soon return aboard a spaceship, the ""Mother Plane"" or ""Mother Ship"", to wipe out the white race and establish a utopia. Members worship in buildings called mosques or temples. Practitioners are expected to live disciplined lives, adhering to strict dress codes, specific dietary requirements, and patriarchal gender roles. Wallace Fard Muhammad established the Nation of Islam in Detroit. He drew on various sources, including Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple of America, black nationalist trends like Garveyism, and black-oriented forms of Freemasonry.

Afrofuturism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism,"Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic, philosophy of science, and history that explores the intersection of the African diaspora culture with science and technology. It addresses themes and concerns of the African diaspora through technoculture and speculative fiction, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afro-diasporic experiences. While Afrofuturism is most commonly associated with science fiction, it can also encompass other speculative genres such as Afro-fantasy, fantasy, alternate history and magic realism, and can also be found in music. The term was coined by American cultural critic Mark Dery in  and explored in the late s through conversations led by Alondra Nelson. Ytasha L. Womack, writer of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture, defines it as ""an intersection of imagination, technology, the future and liberation"". She also follows up with a quote by the curator Ingrid LaFleur, who defines it as ""a way of imagining possible futures through a black cultural lens"". Kathy Brown paraphrases Bennett Capers'  work in stating that Afrofuturism is about ""forward thinking as well as backward thinking, while having a distressing past, a distressing present, but still looking forward to thriving in the future"". Others have said that the genre is ""fluid and malleable"", bringing together technology, African culture, and ""other influences"". Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler; the canvases of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Angelbert Metoyer, and the photography of Renée Cox; the cosmic avant-garde jazz of Sun Ra and his Arkestra; the explicitly extraterrestrial mythos of Parliament-Funkadelic; Earth, Wind and Fire with their overt Afrocentric symbolism, bold performance attire and hopeful visions of Black sovereignty; Herbie Hancock's partnership with Robert Springett and other visual artists, while developing his use of synthesizer",Afrofuturism | 1993 neologisms | Art movements | African-American culture | Science fiction genres,2025-06-22 19:39:54
African-American Vernacular English,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English,"African-American Vernacular Englisha (AAVE)b is the variety of English natively spoken, particularly in urban communities, by most working- and middle-class African Americans and some Black Canadians. Having its own unique grammatical, vocabulary, and accent features, AAVE is employed by middle-class Black Americans as the more informal and casual end of a sociolinguistic continuum. However, in formal speaking contexts, speakers tend to switch to more standard English grammar and vocabulary, usually while retaining elements of the vernacular (non-standard) accent. AAVE is widespread throughout the United States, but is not the native dialect of all African Americans, nor are all of its speakers African American. Like most varieties of African-American English, African-American Vernacular English shares a large portion of its grammar and phonology with the regional dialects of the Southern United States, and especially older Southern American English, due to the historical enslavement of African Americans primarily in that region. Mainstream linguists see only minor parallels between AAVE, West African languages, and English-based creole languages, instead most directly tracing back AAVE to diverse non-standard dialects of English as spoken by the English-speaking settlers in the Southern Colonies and later the Southern United States. However, a minority of linguists argue that the vernacular shares so many characteristics with African creole languages spoken around the world that it could have originated as a creole or semi-creole language, distinct from the English language, before undergoing decreolization.c African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) may be considered a dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect. While it is clear that there is a strong historical relationship between AAVE and earlier Southern U.S. dialects, the origins of AAVE are still a matter of debate.",African-American English | Dialects of English | Sociolects,2025-06-22 19:39:56
Soul food,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_food,"Soul food is the ethnic cuisine of African Americans. Originating in the American South from the cuisines of enslaved Africans transported from Africa through the Atlantic slave trade, soul food is closely associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States. The expression ""soul food"" originated in the mid-s when ""soul"" was a common word used to describe African-American culture. Soul food uses cooking techniques and ingredients from West African, Central African, Western European, and Indigenous cuisine of the Americas. The cuisine was initially denigrated as low quality and belittled because of its origin. It was seen as low-class food, and African Americans in the North looked down on their Black Southern compatriots who preferred soul food (see the Great Migration). The concept evolved from describing the food of slaves in the South, to being taken up as a primary source of pride in the African American community even in the North, such as in New York City, Chicago and Detroit. Soul food historian Adrian Miller said the difference between soul food and Southern food is that soul food is intensely seasoned and uses a variety of meats to add flavor to food and adds a variety of spicy and savory sauces. These spicy and savory sauces add robust flavor. This method of preparation was influenced by West African cuisine where West Africans create sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. Black Americans also add sugar to make cornbread, while ""white southerners say when you put sugar in corn bread, it becomes cake"".  Bob Jeffries, the author of Soul Food Cookbook, said the difference between soul food and Southern food is: ""While all soul food is Southern food, not all Southern food is soul. Soul food cooking is an example of how really good Southern African-American cooks cooked with what they had available to them.""

Black church,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church,"The Black church (sometimes termed Black Christianity or African American Christianity) is the faith and body of Christian denominations and congregations in the United States that predominantly minister to, and are led by, African Americans, as well as these churches' collective traditions and members. Black churches primarily arose in the th century, during a time when race-based slavery and racial segregation were both commonly practiced in the United States. Black people generally searched for an area where they could independently express their faith, find leadership, and escape from inferior treatment in white dominated churches. Throughout many African American houses, churches reflect a deep cultural emphasis on community and shared spiritual experience. For African Americans, the church is a dynamic, living body of believers whose collective faith and fellowship are central, regardless of the physical space. This difference highlights the unique cultural and historical significance that the African American community places on the act of gathering and the people themselves, rather than the location. The number of Black churches in the United States is substantial. According to the Pew Research Center in , there were approximately , Black churches across the country, encompassing a wide range of denominations and independent congregations. A majority of African American congregations are affiliated with Protestant denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), or the National Baptist Convention and related churches, some of them are affiliated with predominantly white Protestant denominations such as the United Church of Christ (which developed from the Congregational Church of New England), integrated denominations such as the Church of God, others are independent congregations.

Twenty-first-century estimates place the number of Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa between , and ,,. American black separatist Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in  during the aftermath of the Watts riots as a non-Christian, specifically African-American holiday. Karenga said his goal was to ""give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give black people an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."" For Karenga, a figure in the Black Power movement of the s and s, the creation of such holidays also underscored the essential premise that ""you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction."": – According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning ""first fruits"". First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa and are celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice. Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama.:   It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional ""a"" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.:  During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a ""White"" religion that Black people should shun.

It is celebrated annually on June  to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. The holiday's name, first used in the s, is a combination of the words June and nineteenth, referring to June , , the day when Major General Gordon Granger ordered the final enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas at the end of the American Civil War. In the Civil War period, slavery came to an end in various areas of the United States at different times. Many enslaved Southerners escaped, demanded wages, stopped work, or took up arms against the Confederacy of slave states. In January , Congress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for the national abolition of slavery. By June , almost all of the enslaved population had been freed by the victorious Union Army or by state abolition laws. When the national abolition amendment was ratified in December, the remaining enslaved people in Delaware and in Kentucky were freed. Early Juneteenth celebrations date back to , at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. They spread across the South among newly freed African-Americans and their descendants and became more commercialized in the s and s, often centering on a food festival. Participants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations to the rest of the country. During the Civil Rights Movement of the s, Juneteenth celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to achieve civil rights, but they grew in popularity again in the s, with a focus on African-American freedom and African-American arts. Beginning with Texas by proclamation in , and by legislation in , every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has formally recognized the holiday in some way.

African diaspora,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora,"The African diaspora is the worldwide collection of communities descended from people from Africa. The term most commonly refers to the descendants of the native West and Central Africans who were enslaved and shipped to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade between the th and th centuries, with their largest populations in Brazil, the United States, and Haiti. The term can also be used to refer to African descendants who immigrated to other parts of the world. Scholars identify ""four circulatory phases"" of this migration out of Africa. The phrase African diaspora gradually entered common usage at the turn of the st century. The term diaspora originates from the Greek διασπορά (diaspora, ""scattering"") which gained popularity in English in reference to the Jewish diaspora before being more broadly applied to other populations. Less commonly, the term has been used in scholarship to refer to more recent emigration from Africa. The African Union (AU) defines the African diaspora as consisting: ""of people of native or partial African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union"". Its constitutive act declares that it shall ""invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in the building of the African Union"".

Atlantic slave trade,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade,"The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people to the Americas. European slave ships regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage. Europeans established a coastal slave trade in the th century and trade to the Americas began in the th century, lasting through the th century. The vast majority of those who were transported in the transatlantic slave trade were from Central Africa and West Africa and had been sold by West African slave traders to European slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids. European slave traders gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas. Some Portuguese and Europeans participated in slave raids. As the National Museums Liverpool explains: ""European traders captured some Africans in raids along the coast, but bought most of them from local African or African-European dealers."" European slave traders generally did not participate in slave raids. This was primarily because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than one year during the period of the slave trade due to malaria that was endemic to the African continent. Portuguese coastal raiders found that slave raiding was too costly and often ineffective and opted for established commercial relations. The colonial South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on slave labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which were vying with one another to create overseas empires. The Portuguese, in the th century, were the first to transport slaves across the Atlantic. In , they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed.

Middle Passage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage,"The Middle Passage was the stage of the Atlantic slave trade in which millions of Africans sold for enslavement were forcibly transported to the Americas as part of the triangular slave trade. Ships departed Europe for African markets with manufactured goods (first side of the triangle), which were then traded for captive Africans. Slave ships transported the African captives across the Atlantic (second side of the triangle). The proceeds from selling these enslaved people were then used to buy products such as furs and hides, tobacco, sugar, rum, and raw materials, which would be transported back to Europe (third side of the triangle, completing it). The First Passage was the forced march of Africans from their inland homes, where they had been captured for enslavement by rulers of other African states or members of their own ethnic group, to African ports. Here they were imprisoned until they were sold and loaded onto a ship. The Final Passage was the journey from the port of disembarkation in the Americas to the plantation or other destination for enslavement into forced labor. The Middle Passage across the Atlantic joined these two. Voyages on the Middle Passage were large financial undertakings, generally organized by companies or groups of investors rather than individuals. The first European slave ship transported African captives from São Tomé to New Spain in . Portuguese and Dutch traders dominated the trade in the th and th centuries, though by the th they were supplanted by the British and French. Other European nations involved were Spain, Denmark–Norway, Sweden, Poland–Lithuania, Prussia, and various Italian city-states as well as traders from the United States. The enslaved Africans came mostly from the regions of Senegambia, Upper Guinea, Windward Coast, Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, Bight of Biafra, and Angola.

Slavery in the United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States,"The legal institution of human chattel slavery, comprising the enslavement primarily of Africans and African Americans, was prevalent in the United States of America from its founding in  until , predominantly in the South. Slavery was established throughout European colonization in the Americas. From , during the early colonial period, it was practiced in what became Britain's colonies, including the Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States. Under the law, children were born into slavery, and an enslaved person was treated as property that could be bought, sold, or given away. Slavery lasted in about half of U.S. states until abolition in , and issues concerning slavery seeped into every aspect of national politics, economics, and social custom. In the decades after the end of Reconstruction in , many of slavery's economic and social functions were continued through segregation, sharecropping, and convict leasing. Involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remains legal. By the time of the American Revolutionary War (–), the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry. During and immediately following the Revolution, abolitionist laws were passed in most Northern states and a movement developed to abolish slavery. The role of slavery under the United States Constitution () was the most contentious issue during its drafting. The Three-Fifths Clause of the Constitution gave slave states disproportionate political power, while the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section , Clause ) provided that, if a slave escaped to another state, the other state could not prevent the return of the slave to the person claiming to be his or her owner. All Northern states had abolished slavery to some degree by , sometimes with completion at a future date, and sometimes with an intermediary status of unpaid indentured servitude.

Underground Railroad,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad,"The Underground Railroad was an organized network of secret routes and safe houses used by fugitive slaves to escape to the abolitionist Northern United States and Eastern Canada prior to the  abolition of slavery in the United States. Enslaved Africans and African Americans escaped from slavery as early as the th century and many of their escapes were unaided. However, a network of safe houses generally known as the Underground Railroad began to organize in the s among Abolitionist Societies in the North. It ran north and grew steadily until the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in  by President Abraham Lincoln.  The escapees sought primarily to escape into free states, and potentially from there to Canada. The Underground Railroad started at the place of enslavement. The routes followed natural and man-made modes of transportation - rivers, canals, bays, the Atlantic Coast, ferries and river crossings, road and trails. Locations close to ports, free territories and international boundaries prompted many escapes. As research continues, new routes are discovered and will be represented on the map. The network, primarily the work of free and enslaved African Americans, was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. The enslaved people who risked capture and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the passengers and conductors of the Railroad, respectively. Various other routes led to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished, and to islands in the Caribbean that were not part of the slave trade. An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except –), existed from the late th century until approximately . During the American Civil War, freedom seekers escaped to Union lines in the South to obtain their freedom.

Great Migration (African American),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American),"The Great Migration, sometimes known as the Great Northward Migration or the Black Migration, was the movement of six million African Americans out of the rural Southern United States to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West between  and . It was substantially caused by poor economic and social conditions due to prevalent racial segregation and discrimination in the Southern states where Jim Crow laws were upheld.  In particular, continued lynchings motivated a portion of the migrants, as African Americans searched for social reprieve. The historic change brought by the migration was amplified because the migrants, for the most part, moved to the then-largest cities in the United States (New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.) at a time when those cities had a central cultural, social, political, and economic influence over the United States; there, African Americans established culturally influential communities of their own. According to Isabel Wilkerson, despite the losses they felt leaving their homes in the South, and despite the barriers which the migrants faced in their new homes, the migration was an act of individual and collective agency, which changed the course of American history, a ""declaration of independence"" which was written by their actions. From the earliest U.S. population statistics in  until , more than % of the African-American population lived in the American South, making up the majority of the population in three Southern states, namely Louisiana (until about ), South Carolina (until the s), and Mississippi (until the s).

The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial.

A group of whites then gathered rocks and attempted to force all the black teenagers from the train. Patterson and the other black teenagers were able to ward off the group. The humiliated white teenagers jumped or were forced off the train and reported to a nearby train master that they had been attacked by a group of black teenage boys. Shortly thereafter, the police stopped and searched the train at Paint Rock, Alabama and arrested the black teenage boys. Two young white women were also taken to the jail, where they accused the African American teenage boys of rape.

A bitter civil war in the mid-th century erupted which culminated in the  Battle of Ndondakusuka between the brothers Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. In , a British force invaded Zululand, beginning the Anglo-Zulu War. After an initial Zulu victory at the Battle of Isandlwana in January, the British regrouped and defeated the Zulus in July during the Battle of Ulundi, ending the war. The area was absorbed into the Colony of Natal and later became part of the Union of South Africa.

Musa's reign is often regarded as the zenith of Mali's power and prestige, although he features less in Mandinka oral traditions than his predecessors. He was exceptionally wealthy to an extent that he was described as being inconceivably rich by contemporaries; Time magazine reported: ""There's really no way to put an accurate number on his wealth."" It is known from local manuscripts and travellers' accounts that Mansa Musa's wealth came principally from the Mali Empire's control and taxing of the trade in salt from northern regions and especially from gold panned and mined in Bambuk and Bure to the south. Over a very long period Mali had amassed a large reserve of gold. Mali is also believed to have been involved in the trade in many goods such as ivory, slaves, spices, silks, and ceramics. However, presently little is known about the extent or mechanics of these trades. At the time of Musa's ascension to the throne, Mali consisted largely of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which had become a vassal of Mali. The Mali Empire comprised land that is now part of Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, and the modern state of Mali. Musa went on Hajj to Mecca in , traveling with an enormous entourage and a vast supply of gold. En route he spent time in Cairo, where his lavish gift-giving is said to have noticeably affected the value of gold in Egypt and garnered the attention of the wider Muslim world. Musa expanded the borders of the Mali Empire, in particular incorporating the cities of Gao and Timbuktu into its territory. He sought closer ties with the rest of the Muslim world, particularly the Mamluk and Marinid Sultanates. He recruited scholars from the wider Muslim world to travel to Mali, such as the Andalusian poet Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, and helped establish Timbuktu as a center of Islamic learning.

It grew out of the previous Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo around the th century AD; it was annexed by the British Empire in , but endured as a non-sovereign monarchy. In the th and th centuries, the kingdom reached the height of its prosperity, expanding its territory, trading with European powers, and creating a remarkable artistic legacy in cast bronze, iron, brass, carved ivory, and other materials. By the st century BC, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around A.D. , but hunting and gathering of animals still remained important. Also by A.D. , iron was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory. Benin City (formerly Edo) sprang up by around A.D. , and was located in a forest that could be easily defended. The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The rainforest helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources that could be exploited – fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building.

Due to the empire's military prowess, wealth, architecture, sophisticated hierarchy and culture, the Asante Empire has been extensively studied and has more historic records written by European, primarily British, authors than any other indigenous culture of sub-Saharan Africa. Starting in the late th century, the Asante king Osei Tutu (c.  – ) and his adviser Okomfo Anokye established the Asante Kingdom, with the Golden Stool of Asante as a sole unifying symbol. Osei Tutu oversaw a massive Asante territorial expansion, building up the army by introducing new organisation and turning a disciplined royal and paramilitary army into an effective fighting machine. In , the Asante army conquered Denkyira, giving the Asante access to the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean coastal trade with Europeans, notably the Dutch. The economy of the Asante Empire was mainly based on the trade of gold and agricultural exports as well as slave trading, craft work and trade with markets further north. The Asante Empire fought several wars with neighboring kingdoms and lesser organized groups such as the Fante. The Asante held their own against the British in the first two of the five Anglo-Ashanti Wars, killing British army general Sir Charles MacCarthy and keeping his skull as a gold-rimmed drinking cup in . British forces later burnt and sacked the Asante capital of Kumasi, however, and following the final Asante defeat at the fifth Anglo-Ashanti War, the Asante empire became part of the Gold Coast colony on  January .

While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity, the Empire managed to expand significantly under the crusades of Amda Seyon I (–) and Dawit I (–), temporarily becoming the dominant force in the Horn of Africa. The Ethiopian Empire would reach its peak during the long reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob (–). He consolidated the conquests of his predecessors, built numerous churches and monasteries, encouraged literature and art, centralized imperial authority by substituting regional warlords with administrative officials, and significantly expanded his hegemony over adjacent Islamic territories. The neighboring Muslim Adal Sultanate began to threaten the empire by repeatedly attempting to invade it, finally succeeding under Imam Mahfuz. Mahfuz's ambush and defeat by Emperor Lebna Dengel brought about the early th-century jihad of the Ottoman-supported Adalite Imam Ahmed Gran, who was defeated in  with the help of the Portuguese. Greatly weakened, much of the Empire's southern territory and vassals were lost due to the Oromo migrations. In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse Ottoman invasion attempts, although losing its a",Ethiopian Empire | Countries in precolonial Africa | Christian states | 2nd millennium in Ethiopia | 1270 establishments,2025-06-22 19:40:34
Songhai Empire,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhai_Empire,"The Songhai Empire was a state located in the western part of the Sahel during the th and th centuries. At its peak, it was one of the largest African empires in history. The state is known by its historiographical name, derived from its largest ethnic group and ruling elite, the Songhai people. Sonni Ali established Gao as the empire's capital, although a Songhai state had existed in and around Gao since the th century. Other important cities in the kingdom were Timbuktu and Djenné, where urban-centred trade flourished; they were conquered in  and , respectively. Initially, the Songhai Empire was ruled by the Sonni dynasty (c. –), but it was later replaced by the Askia dynasty (–). During the second half of the th century, Gao and the surrounding region had grown into an important trading center and attracted the interest of the expanding Mali Empire. Mali conquered Gao near the end of the th century. Gao remained under Malian command until the late th century. As the Mali Empire started disintegrating, the Songhai reasserted control of Gao. Songhai rulers subsequently took advantage of the weakened Mali Empire to expand Songhai rule. Under the rule of Sonni Ali, the Songhai surpassed the Malian Empire in area, wealth, and power, absorbing vast regions of the Mali Empire. His son and successor, Sonni Bāru, was overthrown by Muhammad Ture, one of his father's generals. Ture, more commonly known as Askia the Great, instituted political and economic reforms throughout the empire. A series of plots and coups by Askia's successors forced the empire into a period of decline and instability. Askia's relatives attempted to govern the kingdom, but political chaos and several civil wars within the empire ensured the empire's continued decline, particularly during the rule of Askia Ishaq I. The empire experienced a period of stability and a string of military successes during the reign of Askia Daoud.",1591 disestablishments in Africa | 15th-century establishments in Africa | Ancient peoples | Countries in precolonial Africa | Former empires in Africa,2025-06-22 19:40:35
