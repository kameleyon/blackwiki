Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_food,Soul food,African American cuisine soul food,"Soul food is the ethnic cuisine of African Americans. Originating in the American South from the cuisines of enslaved Africans transported from Africa through the Atlantic slave trade, soul food is closely associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States. The expression ""soul food"" originated in the mid-1960s when ""soul"" was a common word used to describe African-American culture. Soul food uses cooking techniques and ingredients from West African, Central African, Western European, and Indigenous cuisine of the Americas. The cuisine was initially denigrated as low quality and belittled because of its origin. It was seen as low-class food, and African Americans in the North looked down on their Black Southern compatriots who preferred soul food (see the Great Migration). The concept evolved from describing the food of slaves in the South, to being taken up as a primary source of pride in the African American community even in the North, such as in New York City, Chicago and Detroit. Soul food historian Adrian Miller said the difference between soul food and Southern food is that soul food is intensely seasoned and uses a variety of meats to add flavor to food and adds a variety of spicy and savory sauces. These spicy and savory sauces add robust flavor. This method of preparation was influenced by West African cuisine where West Africans create sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. Black Americans also add sugar to make cornbread, while ""white southerners say when you put sugar in corn bread, it becomes cake"". Bob Jeffries, the author of Soul Food Cookbook, said the difference between soul food and Southern food is: ""While all soul food is Southern food, not all Southern food is soul. Soul food cooking is an example of how really good Southern [African-American] cooks cooked with what they had available to them."" Impoverished White and Black people in the South cooked many of the same dishes stemming from Southern cooking traditions, but styles of preparation sometimes varied. Certain techniques popular in soul and other Southern cuisines (i.e., frying meat and using all parts of the animal for consumption) are shared with cultures all over the world. The earliest use of the word ""soul food"" to describe a type of cuisine is found in a 1909 published memoir of a former slave named Thomas L. Johnson. Johnson described a church service where the congregation was served food. He wrote: ""There are some, when preaching, only preach three-quarter",Soul food | African-American cuisine | African-American cultural history | American cuisine | Cuisine by ethnicity | Cuisine of the Southern United States | Culture of the Southern United States | Native American cuisine of the Southeastern Woodlands,"1965, 1909",Etymology | History | Transatlantic slave trade | Slavery | Foodways on the Underground Railroad | Slave recipes | Barbecue traditions | Emancipation,,3470,2025-06-22 19:41:28
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_soul_foods_and_dishes,List of soul foods and dishes,African American cuisine soul food,"This is a list of soul foods and dishes. Soul food is the ethnic cuisine of African Americans that originated in the Southern United States during the era of slavery. It uses a variety of ingredients and cooking styles, some of which came from West African and Central African cuisine brought over by enslaved Africans while others originated in Europe. Some are indigenous to the Americas as well, borrowed from Native American cuisine. The foods from West-Central Africa brought to North America during the slave trade were guinea pepper, gherkin, sesame seeds, kola nuts, eggplant, watermelon, rice, cantaloupe, millet, okra, black-eyed peas, yams, and legumes such as kidney beans. These crops became a staple in Southern cuisine in the United States. Soul food dishes were created by enslaved Black Americans using minimal ingredients because slaveholders fed their slaves. Historian John Blassingame's book published in 1972, The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South, was researched from a collection of slave narratives. According to Blassingame's research, some enslaved people received the bare minimum in food and had to supplement their diets by hunting, fishing, and foraging for food. From their limited food sources enslaved African Americans created their meals and new dishes called soul food. Many of the meals prepared by enslaved people were later published in African-American cookbooks after the American Civil war. The dishes the enslaved and their descendants created influenced American southern cuisine. An article from the Alabama News Center explains: ""In recent years, culinary historians and writers have credited Africans with introducing many new cooking techniques (for example, one-pot cooking, deep-fat frying and using smoked meats as seasoning) as well as dishes to the New World. They created gumbo, an adaptation of a traditional west African stew; stewed tomatoes and okra; corn cakes, shrimp and grits; hoppin’ John, jambalaya, red rice and other rice-based dishes; collards and other greens; chow-chow and other pickled vegetables; boiled peanuts and peanut soup; and chitlins and cracklings, among other foods."" During slavery, pork was a main source of meat for enslaved Black Americans. Slaveholders only provided their slaves the parts of the pig they did not eat such as innards (chitlins), pigs' feet, pigs' ears, and pigs' tail. To supplement their diets, enslaved people hunted and fished for food.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Food_(film),Soul Food (film),African American cuisine soul food,"Soul Food is a 1997 American comedy-drama film written and directed by George Tillman Jr. in his major studio debut. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film stars Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long, Michael Beach, Mekhi Phifer, Jeffrey D. Sams, Irma P. Hall, Gina Ravera and Brandon Hammond. The story centers on the trials of an extended Black American family, held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage. Tillman based the family in the film on his own and Soul Food was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films. In 2000, Showtime premiered a one-hour television series based upon the film. In 2015, it was announced that 20th Century Fox is planning a sequel for the film called More Soul Food, written by Tillman. Soul Food, told through the eyes of 11-year-old Ahmad, follows the trials of the Joseph family, a close-knit Chicago family that gets together to have Sunday dinner every week, with plenty of soul food to go around. Mother (Big Mama) Joe has three daughters, who each have had varying success in life: oldest daughter Teri has become a successful lawyer but has a strained relationship with younger sister Maxine, Ahmad's mother, who stole and eventually married Teri's former boyfriend, Kenny. Teri is currently married to Miles, a lawyer who quits his job to pursue his dream of being an R&B musician, which Teri doesn't support. Youngest daughter Robin —nicknamed ""Bird""—has just opened a barbershop/beauty parlor, and married Lem, an ex-convict. Life becomes complicated when Mother Joe, the diabetic but wise and caring matriarch of the family and the glue that holds it together, suffers a debilitating stroke during an operation to amputate her leg and slips into a coma, dying shortly after sharing a last word of advice with Ahmad when she awakens five weeks later. Without her guidance, the family begins to fall apart in the interim. Teri takes in her troubled cousin Faith, who bonds with Miles over a love of the arts. The two are caught having sex by Teri, which later leads to a near-violent confrontation at Kenny and Maxine's anniversary party when she furiously comes after the two with a knife. Meanwhile, Lem gets fired from his job after being caught lying about his criminal record and cannot find a new one for the same reason, so Bird makes an uneasy deal with her former boyfriend Simuel St. James to get Lem a job.",1997 films | Films set in Chicago | Films shot in Chicago | African-American comedy-drama films | English-language comedy-drama films | 20th Century Fox films | Films adapted into television shows | Films directed by George Tillman Jr.,"2015, 2000, 1997",Plot | Main cast | Production | Soundtrack | Reception | Awards and nominations | See also | Notes,"Directed by: George Tillman Jr. | Written by: George Tillman Jr. | Produced by: Tracey E.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Southern_United_States,Cuisine of the Southern United States,African American cuisine soul food,"The cuisine of the Southern United States encompasses diverse food traditions of several subregions, including cuisine of Southeastern Native American tribes, Tidewater, Appalachian, Ozarks, Lowcountry, Cajun, Creole, African American cuisine and Floribbean, Spanish, French, British, Ulster-Scots and German cuisine. In recent history, elements of Southern cuisine have spread to other parts of the United States, influencing other types of American cuisine. Many elements of Southern cooking—tomatoes, squash, corn (and its derivatives, such as hominy and grits), and deep-pit barbecuing—are borrowings from Indigenous peoples of the region (e.g., Cherokee, Caddo, Choctaw, and Seminole). From the Old World, European colonists introduced sugar, flour, milk, eggs, and livestock, along with a number of vegetables; meanwhile, enslaved West Africans trafficked to the North American colonies through the Atlantic slave trade introduced black-eyed peas, okra, eggplant, sesame, sorghum, melons, and various spices. Rice also became prominent in many dishes in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina because the enslaved people who settled the region (now known as the Gullah people), were already quite familiar with the crop. Many Southern foodways are local adaptations of Old World traditions. In Appalachia, many Southern dishes are Scottish or British Border in origin. For instance, the South's fondness for a full breakfast derives from the British full breakfast or fry-up. Pork, once considered informally taboo in Scotland, has taken the place of lamb and mutton. Instead of chopped oats, Southerners have traditionally eaten grits, a porridge normally made from coarsely ground, nixtamalized maize, also known as hominy. Certain regions have been infused with different Old World traditions. Louisiana Creole cuisine draws upon vernacular French cuisine, West African cuisine, and Spanish cuisine; Floribbean cuisine is Spanish-based with obvious Caribbean influences; and Tex-Mex has considerable Mexican and Indigenous influences with its abundant use of New World vegetables (e.g. corn, tomatoes, squash, and peppers) and barbecued meat. In Southern Louisiana, West African influences have persisted in dishes such as gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice. Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American cuisine that have been blended with the methods of early Europeans to form the basis of what is now Southern cuisine.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cuisine,American cuisine,African American cuisine soul food,"American cuisine consists of the cooking style and traditional dishes prepared in the United States, an especially diverse culture in a large country with a long history of immigration. It principally derives from a mixing of European cuisine, Native American and Alaskan cuisine, and African American cuisine, known as soul food. The Northeast, Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, South, West, Southwest, and insular areas all have distinctive elements, reflecting local food resources, local demographics, and local innovation. These developments have also given some states and cities distinctive elements. Hawaiian cuisine also reflects substantial influence from East Asian cuisine and its native Polynesian cuisine. Proximity and territorial expansion has also generated substantial influence from Latin American cuisine, including new forms like Tex-Mex and New Mexican cuisine. Modern mass media and global immigration have brought influences from many other cultures, and some elements of American food culture have become global exports. Local ethnic and religious traditions include Cajun, Louisiana Creole, Pennsylvania Dutch, Mormon, Tlingit, Chinese American, German American, Italian American, Greek American, Jewish American, and Mexican American cuisines. American cooking dates back to the traditions of the Native Americans, whose diet included a mix of farmed and hunted food, and varied widely across the continent. The Colonial period created a mix of new world and Old World cookery, and brought with it new crops and livestock. During the early 19th century, cooking was based mostly on what the agrarian population could grow, hunt, or raise on their land. With an increasing influx of immigrants, and a move to city life, American food further diversified in the later part of the 19th century. The 20th century saw a revolution in cooking as new technologies, the World Wars, a scientific understanding of food, and continued immigration combined to create a wide range of new foods. This has allowed for the current rich diversity in food dishes throughout the country. The popularity of the automobile in the 20th century also influenced American eating habits in the form of drive-in and drive-through restaurants. American cuisine includes milkshakes, barbecue, and a wide range of fried foods. Many quintessential American dishes are unique takes on food originally from other culinary traditions, including pizza, hot dogs, and Tex-Mex.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism,Afrofuturism,Afrofuturism movement,"Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic, philosophy of science, and history that explores the intersection of the African diaspora culture with science and technology. It addresses themes and concerns of the African diaspora through technoculture and speculative fiction, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afro-diasporic experiences. While Afrofuturism is most commonly associated with science fiction, it can also encompass other speculative genres such as Afro-fantasy, fantasy, alternate history and magic realism, and can also be found in music. The term was coined by American cultural critic Mark Dery in 1993 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by Alondra Nelson. Ytasha L. Womack, writer of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture, defines it as ""an intersection of imagination, technology, the future and liberation"". She also follows up with a quote by the curator Ingrid LaFleur, who defines it as ""a way of imagining possible futures through a black cultural lens"". Kathy Brown paraphrases Bennett Capers' 2019 work in stating that Afrofuturism is about ""forward thinking as well as backward thinking, while having a distressing past, a distressing present, but still looking forward to thriving in the future"". Others have said that the genre is ""fluid and malleable"", bringing together technology, African culture, and ""other influences"". Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler; the canvases of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Angelbert Metoyer, and the photography of Renée Cox; the cosmic avant-garde jazz of Sun Ra and his Arkestra; the explicitly extraterrestrial mythos of Parliament-Funkadelic; Earth, Wind and Fire with their overt Afrocentric symbolism, bold performance attire and hopeful visions of Black sovereignty; Herbie Hancock's partnership with Robert Springett and other visual artists, while developing his use of synthesizers. The Jonzun Crew, Warp 9, Deltron 3030, Kool Keith, and the Marvel Comics superhero Black Panther can also be cited.",Afrofuturism | 1993 neologisms | Art movements | African-American culture | Science fiction genres | Futurism by region | African diaspora literature,"1993, 2019",History | Mid- to late 20th-century development in music | Cultural criticism in the 1990s | 21st century | Literature and comics | Art | Museum and gallery exhibitions | Themes,,2130,2025-06-22 19:40:25
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucyl,Rucyl,Afrofuturism movement,"Rucyl is a new media and sound artist, singer, musician, and producer. Her interests involve experimentation and process as performance, time-based analog effects systems, and using sound to represent concepts that are non-tactile (time, natural forces, emotion, identity, and physics). Her earlier experimental works incorporated vocal improvisation and computer generated algorithmic music in tandem with generated visual projections, using Max MSP and VJ software. Rucyl improvises during her live performances using MIDI controllers, loopers, diy software and hardware, and effects processors. Rucyl was an original member of underground hip-hop group The Goats (Ruffhouse/Columbia Records) from 1992-1994. The Goats toured and performed internationally with bands like Bad Brains, Fishbone, and The Beastie Boys. Her first interactive pieces included the Chakakhantroller, a wearable interface MIDI controller for audio and visual performance, and installation Watch What You Are, in collaboration with Justin Downs, which was featured as part of Eyebeam Interactive Art Gallery's ""Double Take"" exhibition in July 2008. Also in 2008, Rucyl co-founded Saturn Never Sleeps (SNS), a futuretronic label and audiovisual group created during the resurgence of the contemporary Afrofuturism movement, with DJ/producer King Britt. Saturn Never Sleeps was founded on the principles of process as performance, inspired greatly by the media and music of the great experimental jazz musician, Sun Ra. These collaborative, audiovisual live performances were featured at The Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, Painted Bride Art Center, The River To River Festival at the World Financial Center in New York City, Art Basel in Miami, and Moogfest in Asheville, NC. Rucyl traveled internationally with SNS to Istanbul, Berlin, Madrid, Switzerland (Stadtmusik Festival) and Tokyo (Micro-cosmos). Curated performances in Philadelphia and Brooklyn included artists Taylor McFerrin, Ras G, Sarah White, Teebs, Ben Neill, Flying Lotus, Stef Eye, Shabazz Palaces, and Tokimonsta. In June 2010, the Leeway Foundation featured Rucyl on a ""Women in Indie Music"" panel where she discussed the re-emerging lo-fi/DIY aesthetic in music, digital distribution and the place of activism within her art. In spring 2011, Saturn Never Sleeps opened for TV on the Radio, and appeared with the Sun Ra Arkestra at Eyebeam's event ""Past Futures.""

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra,Sun Ra,Afrofuturism movement,"Le Sony'r Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, May 22, 1914 – May 30, 1993), better known as Sun Ra, was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, ""cosmic"" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led The Arkestra, an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Le Sony'r Ra, shortened to Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian god of the Sun). Claiming to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. Throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying, ""Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym."" His widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz, from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz, to swing music, bebop, free jazz and fusion. His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians, along with electronic excursions, songs, chants, percussion pieces, and anthems. From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra, which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations. Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age. Following Ra's retirement in 1992 due to illness, the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra, and, as of 2024, continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen. Though his mainstream success was limited, Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer, and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona. He is now widely considered an innovator; among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Over his career, he recorded dozens of singles and over 100 full-length albums, comprising well over 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century.",Sun Ra | Sun Ra Arkestra members | 1914 births | 1993 deaths | 20th-century African-American male singers | 20th-century American male singers | 20th-century American singers | 20th-century American keyboardists,"1914, 1993, 2024, 1992",Biography | Early life | Early professional career and college | Trip to Saturn | New devotion to music (late 1930s) | Draft and wartime experiences | Chicago years (1945–1961) | New York years (1961–1968),"Birth name: Herman Poole Blount | Also known as: Le Sony'r Ra (legal name) | Born: (1914-05-22)May 22, 1914Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. | Died: May 30, 1993(1993-05-30) (aged 79)Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. | Genres: Jazz

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Funk_mythology,P-Funk mythology,Afrofuturism movement,"The P-Funk mythology is a group of recurring characters, themes, and ideas primarily contained in the output of George Clinton's bands Parliament and Funkadelic. This ""funkology"" was outlined in album liner notes and song lyrics, in addition to album artwork, costumes, advertisements, and stage banter. P-Funk's ""Dr. Seussian afrofunk"" is often cited as a critical component of the Afrofuturism movement. George Clinton's space-age mythology began to emerge with the release of Funkadelic's self-titled debut album in 1970. Later that same year, Parliament released their debut album Osmium. Clinton's cosmology was largely absent from the latter release, and it took longer to blossom in Parliament's output. Generally speaking, Parliament was a dance-oriented band, while Funkadelic was more serious and psychedelic. The two bands shared personnel, and Clinton blurred the lines between them both by referring to his touring band as ""A Parliafunkadelicment Thang"". The shorthand for this conglomerate became ""P-Funk"", and it grew to include offshoots like P-Funk All Stars, Bootsy's Rubber Band, Parlet, The Brides of Funkenstein, The Horny Horns, and solo albums by Eddie Hazel and Bernie Worrell. By the mid 70s, P-Funk was a massively successful group of acts. A ranking of the top live acts of 1977 included three bands from the conglomerate in the top fifteen slots. After the bands' earlier releases, Clinton began to feel that something more conceptual was in order, and he expressed deep admiration for The Who's Tommy and The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as ""the classiest two pieces of music I had ever seen where everything related to each other. So I wanted to do one of those kinds of things."" Clinton settled on the extraterrestrial concept because of its originality, saying, ""Put niggas in places that you don't usually see 'em. And nobody had seen 'em on no spaceships! Once you seen 'em sittin' on spaceships like it was Cadillac then it was funny, cool."" The primary author of the P-Funk mythology aside from George Clinton was Pedro Bell, who illustrated the liners for many of P-Funk's releases. Bell's felt-tip illustrations included prolonged essays that expanded the mythos of Clinton's lyrics with a complementary syntax that ""forged a new realm of black language"". Though Bell coined terms like ""Rumpasaurus"" and made extensive contributions to the P-Funk mythology, his work has been largely overlooked.",P-Funk | Concept album series | Fictional characters invented for recorded music | Afrofuturism | Mythopoeia,"1970, 1977",Background | Funkadelic | Parliament | Mothership Connection | Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome | Later albums | Stage show | P-Funk mythology in popular culture,,2451,2025-06-22 19:40:29

An influential figure in world music, he rose to prominence in 2004 following the release of his single ""Locked Up"" (featuring Styles P). Styled in hip-hop, it preceded the release of his debut studio album Trouble (2004), which became his commercial breakthrough and spawned the R&B-styled follow-up, ""Lonely"" the following year. His second album, Konvicted (2006), was met with continued success and was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, while its lead singles, ""I Wanna Love You"" (featuring Snoop Dogg) and ""Smack That"" (featuring Eminem), both received nominations for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The songs simultaneously peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively, along with two of his singles released the following year: ""Don't Matter"" and his guest performance on Gwen Stefani's ""The Sweet Escape""; this made Akon the first solo artist to concurrently hold the top two positions on the chart twice. His third album, Freedom (2008), was supported by the top ten single, ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"", as well as the top 40 singles ""I'm So Paid"" (featuring Lil Wayne and Jeezy) and ""Beautiful"" (featuring Colby O'Donis and Kardinal Offishall). His fourth album, El Negreeto (2019), explored reggaeton and Latin music, while his fifth album, Akonda (also 2019), explored Afrobeats; both of which failed to chart. Along with his solo career, Akon has guest performed on 23 Billboard Hot 100 entries for other artists—such activity earned him two additional Grammy Award nominations. Akon founded the record labels Konvict Muzik in 2004 and KonLive Distribution in 2007, through which he has signed commercially successful acts including Lady Gaga, T-Pain, R. City, Kardinal Offishall, Jeffree Star and French Montana, among others.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon_City,Akon City,Akon singer,"Akon City is a planned community and city in the M'bour Department of Senegal by Senegalese-American singer and entrepreneur Akon. The project was first announced by Akon in 2018. Akon said in October 2022 that construction of the city's first phase would begin in 2023 and be completed in 2028. Akon said he was inspired by the movie Black Panther, and he refers to Akon City as a ""real-life Wakanda"" that uses modern technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency. Akon City's status is unknown. Akon has not spoken openly about Akon City since 2022. The only part of Akon City that has been constructed or at least partially is the Akon City Welcome Center. Its construction is currently ""on hold"" and it is labelled on Google as a ""city government office"" in Senegal. Akon announced Akoin, a cryptocurrency, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in 2018. On January 15, 2020, Akon announced plans for Akon City. In September 2020, Akon unveiled a rendering of a planned development of a futuristic city along the Atlantic coast. It is 100 km (62 mi) south of Dakar in Senegal. The planned city would feature condominiums, offices, parks, a university, an ocean resort, and a 5,000-bed hospital. The city is intended to attract tourists and investors; Akon told international media in August 2020 that he planned to retire there. Later renderings included fewer skyscrapers but retained a futuristic design. The city would be located near what is now the village of Mbodiène, a small rural village of about 1,500 people who primarily rely on the agricultural industry. Another Akon City was announced in Uganda on April 6, 2021, by Akon alongside Dr. Chris Baryomunsi, the state minister for Housing and Urban Development, after Akon had met for discussions with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni. Akon further discussed the entire 15-year development project and its alleged benefits to Ugandans in an interview on Uganda's NBS TV with Canary Mugume.",Proposed populated places | Proposed special economic zones | Special economic zones | Planned communities | Neo-futurist architecture | Akon | Populated places in Senegal,"2018, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2020, 2028",History | Potential cancellation | Design | Economy | Controversy | References | External links,Country: Senegal | Region: Thiès Region | Department: M'bour Department | Establishment: 2026 (planned first phase),1980,2025-06-22 19:32:47
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_(Akon_song),Lonely (Akon song),Akon singer,"""Lonely"" is a song by Senegalese-American singer-songwriter Akon; it appears on his debut studio album, Trouble. Featuring a prominent, high-pitched sample of the 1964 song ""Mr. Lonely"" by Bobby Vinton, the single was released on February 22, 2005. ""Lonely"" reached number one in several countries, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where it stayed for eight weeks. It also entered the top five in France, where it reached number two, and in the United States, where it peaked at number four. When Akon was signed by Universal imprint SRC Records it was ""Lonely"" that had immediately caught the attention of SRC A&R Jerome Foster and convinced him of Akon's talents. On hearing the demo track he had said, ""This kid is official - this is a huge record."" Despite offering the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough, SRC Records chose ""Locked Up"" over ""Lonely"" as the first single because SRC wanted to break Akon in the streets first and work towards a cross-over. According to Foster in an interview with HitQuarters, """"Locked Up"" is a street record. I thought that was the place for us to start to get a fan-base knowing that we had a record like ""Lonely"", which was more commercial, to follow it."" The song was written by Akon, Bobby Vinton, and Gene Allan. The lyrics are sung mainly by Akon as well as Bobby Vinton doing parts of the choruses, with Vinton's voice sped up reminiscent of Alvin and the Chipmunks. The song's tempo is 90 beats per minute in common time. ""Lonely"" is written in the key of C major. A music video was produced to promote the single. The video was mostly filmed inside and in front of the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The video was directed by Gil Green. Actress Katerina Graham starred in the video as Akon's love partner. A competition winner from Blackpool, Daniel Ellwood, also starred in the video.[citation needed]",2005 songs | 2005 singles | Akon songs | Dutch Top 40 number-one singles | European Hot 100 Singles number-one singles | Irish Singles Chart number-one singles | Music videos directed by Gil Green | Number-one singles in Australia,"2005, 1964",Background | Music video | Track listings | Charts | Weekly charts | Year-end charts | Decade-end charts | Certifications,"Released: February 22, 2005 (2005-02-22) | Genre: Pop[1]chipmunk soul[2]R&B[3] | Length: 3:55 | Label: SRCUniversal",1894,2025-06-22 19:32:48

The album was originally named Acquitted; however, Akon changed it before it was released. It was released as a download on December 1, 2008, and in stores December 2, 2008. The album debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200 with 110,600 copies sold in its first week. Production on the album began in May 2008 and ended in late of the same year. Originally the album was to be called Acquitted, but was later confirmed to be Freedom by Akon's label, Universal Music. Although there are some vulgarities on Freedom, it does not carry the Parental Advisory warning, making it Akon's first album not to do so. In July, a leaked recording of Akon's duet with Michael Jackson titled ""Hold My Hand"" was released to the Internet and at first showings of the song was supposedly taken out by Akon's music label. The song was originally posted as an Akon demo with only Akon performing the song. The leaked song was rumored to be featured on both his and Jackson's own upcoming album. In an interview with MTV, Akon was hopeful to include the song on the album. However, on October 17, Akon's label released information on the track listing and the album does not feature the duet with Jackson. The UK bonus track, ""Clap Again"" samples ""Click Click Click"" by New Kids on the Block. The leaked version of the lead single ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" included verse rapper Danny Fernandes but never made the final cut; Akon decided to go solo. The tracks ""Against the Grain"" and ""We Don't Care"" were originally named ""Falling in Love"" and ""Could You Be the Reason"" respectively. ""Troublemaker"" seems to be a continuation of Akon's first solo #1 Billboard Hot 100 single ""Don't Matter"", with the lyrics suggesting that it is, as he says ""Similar to the words it don't matter, but this time they wanna see us together, look at us now."" Freedom has a score of 58 out of 100 from Metacritic based on ""mixed or average reviews"". Rolling Stone described Akon's third studio album as ""melodrama about love and love lost delivered in a hooting style over synth-swamped beats."" Dan LeRoy of The Hartford Courant gave a positive review to the album, stating, ""Akon's undeniable gift for hooks makes this an easy listen, and the ex-con posturing isn't missed.""

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt,Ancient Egypt,Ancient Egypt civilization,"Ancient Egypt was a cradle of civilization concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in Northeast Africa. It emerged from prehistoric Egypt around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology), when Upper and Lower Egypt were amalgamated by Menes, who is believed by the majority of Egyptologists to have been the same person as Narmer. The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by the ""Intermediate Periods"" of relative instability. These stable kingdoms existed in one of three periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age; the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age; or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. The pinnacle of ancient Egyptian power was achieved during the New Kingdom, which extended its rule to much of Nubia and a considerable portion of the Levant. After this period, Egypt entered an era of slow decline. Over the course of its history, it was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign civilizations, including the Hyksos, the Kushites, the Assyrians, the Persians, and, most notably, the Greeks and then the Romans. The end of ancient Egypt is variously defined as occurring with the end of the Late Period during the Wars of Alexander the Great in 332 BC or with the end of the Greek-ruled Ptolemaic Kingdom during the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. In AD 642, the Arab conquest of Egypt brought an end to the region's millennium-long Greco-Roman period. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the Nile's conditions for agriculture. The predictable flooding of the Nile and controlled irrigation of its fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and thereby substantial social and cultural development. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored the mineral exploitation of the valley and its surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with other civilizations, and a military to assert Egyptian dominance throughout the Near East. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of the reigning pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs. Among the many achievements of ancient Egypt are: the quarrying, surveying,",Ancient Egypt | Bronze Age civilizations | Cradle of civilization | Former empires in Africa | Former empires in Asia | Ancient peoples | History of Egypt by period | History of the Mediterranean,,History | Predynastic period | Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150–2686 BC) | Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC) | First Intermediate Period (2181–2055 BC) | Middle Kingdom (2134–1690 BC) | Second Intermediate Period (1674–1549 BC) and the Hyksos | New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC),Capital: See List of historical capitals of Egypt | Common languages: Egyptian language | Religion: Egyptian religion | Historical era: Ancient history,3425,2025-06-22 19:35:02
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization,Cradle of civilization,Ancient Egypt civilization,"A cradle of civilization is a location and a culture where civilization was developed independent of other civilizations in other locations. A civilization is any complex society characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems and graphic arts). Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization: Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient India and Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in Afro-Eurasia, while the Caral–Supe civilization of coastal Peru and the Olmec civilization of Mexico are believed to be the earliest in the Americas. All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance (except possibly Caral–Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus to support the centralized government, political leaders, religious leaders, and public works of the urban centers of the early civilizations. Less formally, the term ""cradle of Western civilization"" is often used to refer to other historic ancient civilizations, such as Greece or Rome. The earliest signs of a process leading to sedentary culture can be seen in the Levant to as early as 12,000 BC, when the Natufian culture became sedentary; it evolved into an agricultural society by 10,000 BC. The importance of water to safeguard an abundant and stable food supply, due to favourable conditions for hunting, fishing and gathering resources including cereals, provided an initial wide spectrum economy that triggered the creation of permanent villages.",Cradle of civilization | Ancient history | Ancient Near East | Civilizations by time | History of the Mediterranean | Archaeology of the Near East | Archaeological terminology | Origins,,Rise of civilization | Single or multiple cradles | Cradles of civilization | Fertile Crescent | Ancient India | Ancient China | Ancient Andes | Mesoamerica,,1661,2025-06-22 19:35:03
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy,Ancient Egyptian race controversy,Ancient Egypt civilization,"The question of the race of the ancient Egyptians was raised historically as a product of the early racial concepts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry and anthropometry. A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture. Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, or the Middle East, while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe. In more recent times, some writers continued to challenge the mainstream view, some focusing on questioning the race of specific notable individuals, such as the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, the native Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, the Egyptian queen Tiye, and the Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII. At a UNESCO symposium in 1974, a majority of the international scholars at the event favoured a hypothesis of a mixed population whereas a minority favoured a view of an homogeneous, African population. Mainstream Western scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a ""white"" or ""black"" civilization; they maintain that applying modern notions of black or white races to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. In addition, scholars reject the notion – implicit in a black or white Egypt hypothesis – that ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin colour varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who rose to power in various eras of ancient Egypt. Within Egyptian history, despite multiple foreign invasions, the demographics were not shifted substantially by large migrations.",Ancient Egyptian race controversy | African and Black nationalism | Ancient Egypt | Eurocentrism | Egyptian nationalism | Fringe theories | Historical revisionism | Politics and race,1974,Background | 1974 UNESCO committee | Position of modern scholarship | Scholarly views on bias | Present-day controversies | Tutankhamun | Cleopatra | Great Sphinx of Giza,,1726,2025-06-22 19:35:04
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_trade,Ancient Egyptian trade,Ancient Egypt civilization,"Ancient Egyptian trade developed with the gradual creation of land and sea trade routes connecting the ancient Egyptian civilization with ancient India, the Fertile Crescent, Arabia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Epipaleolithic Natufians carried parthenocarpic figs from Africa to the southeastern corner of the Fertile Crescent, c. 10,000 BCE. Later migrations out of the Fertile Crescent would carry early agricultural practices to neighboring regions—westward to Europe and North Africa, northward to Crimea, and eastward to Mongolia. The ancient people of the Sahara imported domesticated animals from Asia between 6000 and 4000 BCE. In Nabta Playa by the end of the 7th millennium BCE, prehistoric Egyptians had imported goats and sheep from Southwest Asia. Foreign artifacts dating to the 5th millennium BCE in the Badarian culture in Egypt indicate contact with distant Syria. In predynastic Egypt, by the beginning of the 4th millennium BCE, ancient Egyptians in Maadi were importing pottery as well as construction ideas from Canaan. By the 4th millennium BCE shipping was well established, and the donkey and possibly the dromedary had been domesticated. Domestication of the Bactrian camel and use of the horse for transport then followed. Charcoal samples found in the tombs of Nekhen, which were dated to the Naqada I and II periods, have been identified as cedar from Lebanon. Predynastic Egyptians of the Naqada I period also imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes. The Naqadans traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east.",Foreign contacts of ancient Egypt | History of international trade | Ancient Egyptian culture | Ancient international relations | Economic history of Egypt,,Prehistoric transport and trade | Trans-Saharan trade | Maritime trade | Canal construction | References,,1667,2025-06-22 19:35:08

Franklin,Aretha Franklin,"Clarence LaVaughn Franklin (né Walker; January 22, 1915 – July 27, 1984) was an American Baptist minister and civil rights activist. Known as the man with the ""Million-Dollar Voice"", Franklin served as the pastor of New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit from 1946 until 1979, when in a suspected robbery attempt he was shot twice and spent his remaining five years in a coma. Franklin was the father of the American singer and songwriter Aretha Franklin. He was also the father of five other children, including Vaughn Franklin, Erma Franklin, Cecil Franklin, Carolyn Franklin and Carol Ellan. Franklin was born Clarence LaVaughn Walker in Bolivar County, Mississippi, United States, to sharecroppers Willie and Rachel (née Pittman) Walker (1897-1988). C. L. Franklin would recall that the only thing his father did for him was to teach him to salute when he returned from service in World War I in 1919. Willie Walker abandoned the family when Clarence was four years old. The next year, Rachel married Henry Franklin, whose surname the family adopted. Franklin became a preacher at age 16, initially working the black itinerant preaching circuit before settling at New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, where he remained until May 1944. From there he moved to the pulpit of the Friendship Baptist Church in Buffalo, New York, where he served until June 1946 when he became pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit. Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s his fame grew. He preached throughout the country, while maintaining his pulpit at New Bethel. Known as the man with the ""Million Dollar Voice"", Franklin had many of his sermons recorded into the 1970s (many of them issued by Joe Von Battle's JVB label), and broadcast sermons via radio on Sundays. He commanded up to $4,000 per appearance for his public appearances, high fees for the time. Among Franklin's most famous sermons were ""The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest"" and ""Dry Bones in the Valley"". In 2011, ""The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest"" was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Selected sermons and his life history in his own words are published in a volume edited by Jeff Todd Titon for the University of Illinois Press. Franklin was also known for his singing voice and for mastery of a style of musical preaching traditional in the Black Baptist church called ""whooping"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_(song),Respect (song),Aretha Franklin,"""Respect"" is a song by American soul singer-songwriter Otis Redding, and later rearranged by Aretha Franklin to become her breakout hit. It was released in 1965 as a single from Redding's third album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul and became a crossover hit for Redding. In 1967, Franklin (the ""Queen of Soul"") rearranged, rephrased, and covered ""Respect"", resulting in one of her biggest hits and her signature song. The music in the two versions is significantly different, while a few changes in the lyrics resulted in different narratives around the theme of human dignity that have been interpreted as commentaries on gender roles, relationships and ""respect"". Franklin's interpretation became a feminist anthem for the second-wave feminism movement in the 1970s. It has often been considered one of the best R&B songs of its era, earning Franklin two Grammy Awards in 1968 for ""Best Rhythm & Blues Recording"" and ""Best Rhythm & Blues Solo Vocal Performance, Female"", and being inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored Franklin's version by adding it to the National Recording Registry. It was placed number five on the 2004 version of Rolling Stone magazine's list of ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,"" number one on the 2021 version of the list, and number four on its list of ""The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time."" It was also included in the list of ""Songs of the Century"", by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. At first a ballad, ""Respect"" was brought to Redding by Earl ""Speedo"" Sims, who intended to record it with his band, the Singing Demons. There are differing accounts as to who wrote the original version of the song. Bandleader Percy Welch said it was a guitarist at Bobby Smith's recording studio in Macon. Redding took Sims' version, rewrote the lyrics and sped up the tempo. Sims went with the band to the Muscle Shoals studios, but was unable to produce a good version. Redding then decided to sing the song himself, which Sims agreed to. Redding also promised to credit Sims, but this never happened. Sims never pressed Redding on the issue, possibly because he himself had not really written it in the first place.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade,Atlantic slave trade,Atlantic slave trade,"The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people to the Americas. European slave ships regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage. Europeans established a coastal slave trade in the 15th century and trade to the Americas began in the 16th century, lasting through the 19th century. The vast majority of those who were transported in the transatlantic slave trade were from Central Africa and West Africa and had been sold by West African slave traders to European slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids. European slave traders gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas. Some Portuguese and Europeans participated in slave raids. As the National Museums Liverpool explains: ""European traders captured some Africans in raids along the coast, but bought most of them from local African or African-European dealers."" European slave traders generally did not participate in slave raids. This was primarily because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than one year during the period of the slave trade due to malaria that was endemic to the African continent. Portuguese coastal raiders found that slave raiding was too costly and often ineffective and opted for established commercial relations. The colonial South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on slave labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which were vying with one another to create overseas empires. The Portuguese, in the 16th century, were the first to transport slaves across the Atlantic. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed. Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible, there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and cotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, the construction industry, cutting timber for ships, as skilled labour, and as domestic servants. The first enslaved Africans sent to the English colonies were classified as indentured servants, with legal standing similar to that of contract-based workers coming from Britain and Ireland. By the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, w",Atlantic slave trade | 1525 establishments | 1870 disestablishments | African slave trade | Black British history | Early modern period | European colonisation of Africa | European colonization of the Americas,"1867, 1800, 1600, 1526, 1873","Background | Atlantic travel | European slavery in Portugal and Spain | African slavery | European colonization and slavery in West-Central Africa | 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries | Triangular trade | Labour and slavery",,5336,2025-06-22 19:40:43
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_trade,Triangular trade,Atlantic slave trade,"Triangular trade or triangle trade is trade between three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come. It has been used to offset trade imbalances between different regions. The most commonly cited example of a triangular trade is the Atlantic slave trade, but other examples existed. These include the seventeenth-century carriage of manufactured goods from England to New England and Newfoundland, then dried cod from Newfoundland and New England to the Mediterranean and Iberian peninsula, followed by cargoes of gold, silver, olive oil, tobacco, dried fruit, and ""sacks"" of wine back to England. Maritime carriers referred to this Atlantic trade as the ""sack trade."" Another example was general cargo from Britain to Australia, Australian coal to China, then tea and silk back to Britain. The Atlantic slave trade used a system of three-way transatlantic exchanges – known historically as the triangular trade – which operated between Europe, Africa, and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries. European workers outfitted slave ships, and they shipped manufactured European goods owned by the trading companies to West Africa to get slaves, which they shipped to the Americas, in particular, to Brazil and the Caribbean islands. First, in West Africa, merchants sold or bartered European manufactured goods to local slavers in exchange for slaves. Then crews transported the slaves, and remaining European manufactured goods, to the Americas where ship merchants sold the slaves and European manufactured goods to plantation owners. Merchants then purchased sugar and molasses from the plantation owners and crews shipped them to North American colonies (later the US), where the merchants sold the remaining supplies of European manufactured goods and slaves, as well as sugar and molasses from plantations to local buyers, and then purchased North American commodities to sell in Europe, including tobacco, sugar, cotton, rum, rice, lumber, and animal pelts. This trade, in trade volume, was primarily with South America, where most slaves were sold, but a classic example taught in 20th century studies is the colonial molasses trade, which involved the circuitous trading of slaves, sugar (often in liquid form, as molasses), and rum between West Africa, the West Indies and the northern colonies of British North America in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa,Slavery in Africa,Atlantic slave trade,"Slavery has historically been widespread in Africa. Systems of servitude and slavery were once commonplace in parts of Africa, as they were in much of the rest of the ancient and medieval world. When the trans-Saharan slave trade, Red Sea slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade and Atlantic slave trade (which started in the 16th century) began, many of the pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa. Slavery in contemporary Africa still exists in some regions despite being illegal. In the relevant literature, African slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery, depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the continent. Slavery in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, slavery for prostitution and enslavement of criminals were all practiced in various parts of Africa. Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa. Plantation slavery also occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa. The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century. Due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, many African states that were dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labour. Different forms of slavery and servitude existed throughout African history and were shaped by indigenous practices of slavery as well as the Roman institution of slavery (and the later Christian views on slavery), the Islamic institutions of slavery via the Muslim slave trade, and eventually the Atlantic slave trade. Slavery was part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries, although the extent varied. Ibn Battuta, who visited the ancient kingdom of Mali in the mid-14th century recounts that the local inhabitants competed with each other in the number of slaves and servants they had and was himself given a slave boy as a ""hospitality gift."" In sub-Saharan Africa, the slave relationships were often complex, with rights and freedoms denied individuals held in slavery and restrictions on sale and treatment by their masters. Many communities had hierarchies between different types of slaves: for example, differentiating between those who had been born into slavery and those who had been captured through war.",Slavery in Africa | African slave trade | History of Africa | History of Central Africa | History of West Africa,,Forms | Chattel slavery | Domestic service | Pawnship | Military slavery | Slaves for sacrifice | Local slave trade | Practices by region,,2448,2025-06-22 19:40:45
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade_to_Brazil,Atlantic slave trade to Brazil,Atlantic slave trade,"The Atlantic slave trade to Brazil occurred during the period of history in which there was a forced migration of Africans to Brazil for the purpose of slavery. It lasted from the mid-sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century. During the trade, more than three million Africans were transported across the Atlantic and sold into slavery. It was divided into four phases: The cycle of Guinea (16th century); the cycle of Angola (17th century) which trafficked people from Bakongo, Mbundu, Benguela, and Ovambo; cycle of Costa da Mina, now renamed Cycle of Benin and Dahomey (18th century - 1815), which trafficked people from Yoruba, Ewe, Minas, Hausa, Nupe, and Borno; and the illegal trafficking period, which was suppressed by the United Kingdom (1815–1851). During this period, to escape the supervision of British ships enforcing an anti-slavery blockade, Brazilian slave traders began to seek alternative routes to the routes of the West African coast, turning to Mozambique. The slave trade had already a strong presence in Africa for thousands of years, at the time of the European Age of Discovery. The Portuguese began contact with the African slave markets to rescue civilians and military captives since the time of the Reconquista. At this time, the Alfaqueque was the one who had the mission to negotiate captives rescue. When Catherine of Austria authorized the slave trade to Brazil, the slave trade from Africa, which was previously dominated by Africans, started also to be dominated by Europeans. The lists of enslaved captives for ransom and freed during the reign of John V of Portugal reveal that even Brazilians were captured and sold in African markets. The slave trade to Brazil was not exclusive to European and Brazilian white traders, but it was an activity in which pumbeiros, who were mestizos, free blacks and also former slaves, not only dedicated to the slave trade as controlled trade coastal - in the case of Angola, also part of domestic trade - also played the role of cultural mediators in the Atlantic slave trade of Africa. See Francisco Félix de Sousa, freed at age 17, the largest Brazilian slaves trader. From 1530, with the knowledge gained in the manufacture of sugar in the islands of Madeira and São Tomé, and then with the creation in 1549 of the General Government to Brazil, the Portuguese Crown sought to encourage the construction of sugar mills in Brazil.

It is the site of the historic capital of the Aksumite Empire. Axum is located in the Central Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base of the Adwa mountains. It has an elevation of 2,131 metres (6,991 feet) and is surrounded by La'ilay Maychew, a separately administered woreda of the Tigray region. In 1980, UNESCO added Axum's archaeological sites to its list of World Heritage Sites due to their historic value. Prior to the beginning of the Tigray War in 2020, Axum was a leading tourist destination for foreign visitors. Little information is available regarding the early centuries of Aksum's presumed evolution from a humble regional hub to a dominant power. Archeological findings at Gobadra (Gobo Dara) and the Anqar Baahti rock-shelters suggest Stone Age remnants in close proximity. R. Fattovich's excavations at amba 'Beta Giyorgis above Aksum validate the pre-Aksumite roots of a settlement in Aksum dating back to approximately 7th to 4th centuries B.C.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_of_Axum,Obelisk of Axum,Axum ancient kingdom,"The Obelisk of Axum (Tigrinya: ሓወልቲ ኣኽሱም, romanized: ḥawelti Akhsum; Amharic: የአክሱም ሐውልት, romanized: Ye’Åksum ḥāwelt) is a 4th-century CE, 24-metre (79 ft) tall phonolite stele, weighing 160 tonnes (160 long tons; 180 short tons), in the city of Axum in Ethiopia. It is ornamented with two false doors at the base and features decorations resembling windows on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top, which used to be enclosed by metal frames. The 'obelisk'—properly termed a stele[a] or, in the local languages, Tigrinya: hawelti; and church Geʽez: hawelti—is found along with many other steles in the city of Axum in modern-day Ethiopia. The steles were probably carved and erected during the 4th century CE by subjects of the Kingdom of Aksum, an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of steles in Axum was a very old practice. Their function is supposed to be as ""markers"" for underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various ""steles fields"". It is still possible to see primitive, roughly carved steles near more elaborate ""obelisks"". The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called King Ezana's Stele, in the 4th century AD. King Ezana (c. 321 – c. 360), influenced by his childhood tutor Frumentius, introduced Christianity to Axum, precluding the pagan practice of erecting burial steles (it seems that at the feet of each obelisk, together with the grave, there was also a sacrificial altar. Over the course of time, many of these steles fell over due to several reasons: structural collapse (as, probably, in the case of the Great Stele, measuring 33 m), possibly immediately after their erection; earthquakes (Axum is in a seismic zone); or the military incursions of the Imam Ahmad Gragn during the Ethiopian–Adal War from 1529 to 1543. In the 19th century, of the three major ""royal"" steles, only King Ezana's Stele remained erect, shown in the print ""The Obelisk at Axum"" of Henry Salt (1780–1827) and in the photograph taken by Mabel Bent in 1893. Salt travelled back to England with Captain Thomas Fremantle, and the design of the Obelisk of Axum influenced that of the Nelson Monument, Portsdown Hill, near Portsmouth Harbour, for which Fremantle raised the funds.

She was named after an ancient city of Axum in Ethiopia. The Adua-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding Perla class. They displaced 680 long tons (690 t) surfaced and 844 long tons (858 t) submerged. The submarines were 60.18 meters (197 ft 5 in) long, had a beam of 6.45 meters (21 ft 2 in) and a draft of 4.7 meters (15 ft 5 in). For surface running, the boats were powered by two 600-brake-horsepower (447 kW) diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged, each propeller was driven by a 400-horsepower (298 kW) electric motor. They could reach 14 knots (26 km/h; 16 mph) on the surface and 7.5 knots (13.9 km/h; 8.6 mph) underwater. On the surface, the Adua class had a range of 3,180 nautical miles (5,890 km; 3,660 mi) at 10.5 knots (19.4 km/h; 12.1 mph), submerged, they had a range of 74 nmi (137 km; 85 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph). The boats were armed with six internal 53.3-centimeter (21.0 in) torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one 100-millimeter (4 in) deck gun for combat on the surface.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum,Ezana of Axum,Axum ancient kingdom,"Ezana (Ge'ez: ዔዛና, ‘Ezana, unvocalized ዐዘነ ‘zn), (Ancient Greek: Ἠεζάνα, Aezana) was the ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum (320s – c. 360 AD). One of the best-documented rulers of Aksum, Ezana is important as he first adopted for his country the religion of Christianity and the name of Ethiopia. Tradition states that Ezana succeeded his father Ella Amida (Ousanas) as king while still a child but his mother, Sofya then served as regent until he came of age. Ezana was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Aksum to embrace Christianity, after his slave-teacher, Frumentius, converted him. He was the first monarch after Zoskales to be mentioned by contemporary historians, a situation that lead Stuart Munro-Hay to comment that he was ""the most famous of the Aksumite kings before Kaleb."" In early life he considered himself a son of Ares, but later inscriptions show a growing attachment to Christianity. His childhood tutor, the Syrian Christian Frumentius, became head of the Ethiopian Church. A surviving letter from the Arian Roman emperor Constantius II is addressed to ‘Ezana and his brother Saizana and requests that Frumentius be sent to Alexandria to be examined for doctrinal errors and be replaced by Theophilos the Indian; Munro-Hay assumes that ‘Ezana either refused or ignored this request. Ezana also launched several military campaigns, which he recorded in his inscriptions. A pair of inscriptions on a stela in Ge'ez found at Meroë is thought of as evidence of a campaign in the fourth century, either during Ezana's reign, or by a predecessor like Ousanas. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Aksumites destroyed the kingdom of Meroë, others say that archaeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300. Moreover, some view the stela as military aid from Axum to Meroë to quell the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof as to which view is correct is not currently available. On some of the Aksumite coins minted during ‘Ezana's reign appears the motto in Greek ΤΟΥΤΟ ΑΡΕΣΗ ΤΗ ΧΩΡΑ – ""May this please the country"". Munro-Hay comments that this motto is ""a rather attractive peculiarity of Aksumite coinage, giving a feeling of royal concern and responsibility towards the people's wishes and contentment"". A number of coins minted bearing his name were found in the late 1990s at archaeological sites in India, indicating trade contacts in that country.

Roughly triangular in shape, the island measures some 21 miles (34 km) from northwest to southeast and about 14 miles (23 km) from east to west at its widest point. The capital and largest town is Bridgetown, which is also the main seaport. Barbados was inhabited by indigenous peoples – Arawaks and Caribs – prior to the European colonization of the Americas in the 16th century. The island was briefly claimed by the Spanish Empire who saw trees with a beard like feature (hence the name Barbados), and then by Portugal from 1532 to 1620. The island was an English and later a British colony from 1625 until 1966. Sugar cane cultivation in Barbados began in the 1640s, which saw the increasing importation of black slaves from West Africa. Several black slave codes were implemented in the late-17th century which resulted in several slave rebellion attempts, however none was successful. The Consolidated Slave Law was passed following the largest slave rebellion in Barbadian history, this was then followed by the total abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834. Britain continued to rule the island until independence was granted in 1966 and the state became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. From 1966 to 2021, Barbados was a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, modelled on the Westminster system, with Elizabeth II, Queen of Barbados, as head of state. Barbados became a republic on November 30, 2021, under Mia Mottley, thus removing the queen as its head of state.

It is part of the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies and the easternmost island of the Caribbean region. It lies on the boundary of the South American and Caribbean plates. Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown. Inhabited by Kalinago people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other Indigenous peoples, Barbados was claimed for the Crown of Castile by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century. It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511. The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being the introduction of wild boars intended as a supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the Olive Blossom, arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of the island in the name of King James I. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and Barbados became an English and later British colony. During this period, the colony operated on a plantation economy, relying on the labour of African slaves who worked on the island's plantations. Slavery continued until it was phased out through most of the British Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. On 30 November 1966, Barbados moved toward political independence and assumed the status of a Commonwealth realm, becoming a separate jurisdiction with Elizabeth II as the Queen of Barbados. On 30 November 2021, Barbados transitioned to a republic within the Commonwealth, replacing its monarchy with a ceremonial president. Barbados's population is predominantly of African ancestry.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Barbados,Military history of Barbados,Barbados history,"The military history of Barbados comprises hundreds of years of military activity on the island of Barbados, as well as international military and peacekeeping operations in which Barbadians took part. Throughout the colonial history of Barbados, Britain routinely stationed large segments of its West India regimental troops on the island of Barbados. The troops acted principally as a force to secure the island against any invasion by other European powers as well as to help protect other neighbouring British territories in the Eastern Caribbean from invasion. Militia numbers were substantially increased after a series of slave revolts in the West Indies—including Barbados—during the first quarter of the 19th century. So successful were British colonial troop deployments to Barbados, it has been said that Barbados is the only country in the Caribbean region never to have changed hands since the British first landed and established the city of Jamestown (around the first quarter century of the 17th century) until independence. Twelve Barbados men made up the Second Barbados Contingent of Volunteers for the Armed Forces. They were recruited for the Royal Air Force. They left Barbados for England in November 1940 to fight against Germany. One pilot was Errol Walton Barrow, later the first Prime Minister of Barbados, who became an officer in the Royal Air Force. By 1945 Barrow had risen to the rank of flying officer and was appointed as personal navigator to the Commander in Chief of the British Zone of occupied Germany. On 11 September 1942 German submarine U-514 was patrolling the waters of Barbados where it torpedoed the Canadian steam merchant ship Cornwallis off the coastline of the capital city. The ship was brought ashore in Barbados before it was released and was torpedoed a second time and sank. The shipwreck was later turned into a reef and marine park. The prize winning Barbadian novelist Austin Clarke writes in detail surrounding this attack in his novels ""Pig Tails'n Breadfruit: A Culinary Memoir"" and Giller Prize-winning The Polished Hoe. The books talk about the economic hardship felt in Barbados after it was cut off from global trade by Germany. As an independent country, Barbados has a moderate sized military command.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_history_of_Barbados,Music history of Barbados,Barbados history,"The music of Barbados draws on the island's cultural heritage, and the music history of Barbados reflects the island's diverse cultures. While slavery was ongoing (1627–1838) in Barbados, African music included work songs, funereal and religious music. Though slave owners initially allowed dances, this ended in 1688 out of fear that the slaves might plan a rebellion at such festivities. The same 1630 law also prohibited the use of drums and horns, which were feared might be used as communication to facilitate slave rebellions. The elite plantocracy of the island during the colonial era felt that Christianity was ill-suited for slaves; instead, the Church of England sent missionaries to convert the slave population. Any cultural element of apparent African origin was suppressed in the name of promoting Christianity. Legal restrictions furthered this goal by banning parties on Sundays, the Christian day of rest, as well as dances like the outdoors fertility dance, Jean and Johnnie. Traditional African music continued in spite of legal restrictions, including the use of drums and rattles, and declamatory and improvised call and response vocals. Much African music was used in Obeah, an African religion found throughout the island. By the beginning of the 19th century, slaves provided most of the musical accompaniment for plantation festivities, such as the Harvest Home, while the white elites participated in dignity balls. With the slave population approaching three times the white population, many slave owners feared revolts. This led to the Slave Consolidation Act in 1826, which reaffirmed the ban on drums and horns. Christian missionaries also discouraged the performance of African music, which pushed the field underground, where it was passed through secret societies and rituals. Slavery in Barbados was finally ended in 1838, and newly emancipated blacks celebrated with instruments including drums and horns, as well as banjos, tambourines and xylophones. Still, however, the use of horns and drums was discouraged, leading to the primacy of vocal music; at the same time, new Protestant churches from North American moved into the island, bringing with them American parlor music, cowboy songs and revivalist hymns. Following emancipation, ensembles consisting of snare and bass drums, flute and triangle emerged; these were called tuk bands, and may have been based on British fife-and-drum corps. They used African polyrhythms and syncopation, and accompanied the ",Music of Barbados | Music history by country,"1630, 1889, 1826, 1688, 1838, 1627",Early history | 19th century | 20th century | See also | Bibliography | References,,2779,2025-06-22 19:34:36
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Bronzes,Benin Bronzes,Benin Empire bronzes,"The Benin Bronzes are a group of several thousand[a] metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in what is now Edo State, Nigeria. The metal plaques were produced by the Guild of Benin Bronze Casters, now located in Igun Street, also known as Igun-Eronmwon Quarters. Collectively, the objects form the best examples of Benin art and were created from the fourteenth century by artists of the Edo people. The plaques, which in the Edo language are called Ama, depict scenes or represent themes in the history of the kingdom. Apart from the plaques, other sculptures in brass or bronze include portrait heads, jewellery, and smaller pieces. Some of the dramatic sculptures date to the fourteenth century, but the bulk of the collection dates to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is believed that two ""Golden Ages"" in Benin metal workmanship occurred during the reigns of Esigie (fl. 1550) and of Eresoyen (1735–1750), when their workmanship achieved its highest quality. Most of the plaques and other objects were taken by British forces during the Benin Expedition of 1897 as the British Empire's control was being consolidated in Southern Nigeria. This expedition was positioned by British sources as retaliation for a massacre of an unarmed party of British envoys and a large number of their African bearers in January 1897. Some contemporary scholars, such as Dan Hicks, argue that the expedition was part of a broader series of premeditated attacks, framed as retaliatory or punitive, to further European imperialistic and economic interests in Africa. Following the expedition, two hundred pieces were taken to the British Museum in London, while the rest were taken to other European museums. A large number are held by the British Museum with other notable collections in Germany and the United States. Late 19th-century scholars O. M. Dalton and Charles Hercules Read erroneously concluded that Benin knowledge of metallurgy came from the Portuguese traders, who were in contact with Benin in the early modern period. The Kingdom of Benin was a hub of African civilization long before Portuguese traders visited, and bronzes were made in Benin prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. While the collection is known as the Benin Bronzes, like most West African ""bronzes"" the pieces are mostly made of brass of variable composition.[b] There are also pieces made of mixtures of bronze and brass, of wood, of ceramic, and of ivory, among other m",African sculptures in the British Museum | Benin City | Bronze sculptures | Art and cultural repatriation | Nigeria–United Kingdom relations | Nigeria–United States relations | Germany–Nigeria relations | Benin Court Art,"1750, 1897, 1735, 1550","Pre-1897 significance | History | Social context and creation | European interest and the Benin Expedition of 1897 | Division among museums | Subsequent sales, restitutions and repatriations | Opposition | Digital Benin online platform",,3007,2025-06-22 19:36:01
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin,Kingdom of Benin,Benin Empire bronzes,"The Kingdom of Benin, also known as Great Benin, is a traditional kingdom in southern Nigeria. It has no historical relation to the modern republic of Benin, which was known as Dahomey from the 17th century until 1975. The Kingdom of Benin's capital was Edo, now known as Benin City in Edo State, Nigeria. The Benin Kingdom was one of the oldest and most developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa. It grew out of the previous Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo around the 11th century AD; it was annexed by the British Empire in 1897, but endured as a non-sovereign monarchy. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the kingdom reached the height of its prosperity, expanding its territory, trading with European powers, and creating a remarkable artistic legacy in cast bronze, iron, brass, carved ivory, and other materials. By the 1st century BC, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around A.D. 500, but hunting and gathering of animals still remained important. Also by A.D. 500, iron was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory. Benin City (formerly Edo) sprang up by around A.D. 1000, and was located in a forest that could be easily defended. The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The rainforest helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources that could be exploited – fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building. However, domesticated animals could not survive due to a disease spread by tsetse flies; after centuries of exposure, some animals, such as cattle and goats, developed a resistance to the disease.",Kingdom of Benin | Archaeological sites in Nigeria | Prehistoric Africa | World Heritage Sites in Nigeria | Historic buildings and structures in Nigeria | Linear earthworks | Former monarchies of Africa | Countries in precolonial Africa,"1897, 1000, 1975",History | Early | Founding | Height of Power | Civil War | Britain seeks control over trade | The Gallwey Treaty of 1892 | The Massacre of 1897,"Status: Independent until 1897, currently a non-sovereign monarchy within Nigeria | Capital: Edo | Common languages: Edo | Religion: Edo Religion, Catholic Christianity | Government: Monarchy",1746,2025-06-22 19:36:02
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Expedition_of_1897,Benin Expedition of 1897,Benin Empire bronzes,"British Empire The Benin Expedition of 1897 was a punitive expedition by a British force of 1,200 men under Sir Harry Rawson. It came in response to the ambush and slaughter of a 250-strong party led by British Acting Consul General James Phillips of the Niger Coast Protectorate. Rawson's troops captured Benin City and the Kingdom of Benin was eventually absorbed into colonial Nigeria. The expedition freed about 100 Africans enslaved by the Oba. The expedition had significant impacts on the Kingdom of Benin, including the looting of cultural artefacts and the exile of the Oba. At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had retained its independence during the Scramble for Africa, and the Oba of Benin exercised a monopoly over trade in Benin's territories which the Royal Niger Company considered a threat.[citation needed] In 1892, Deputy Commissioner and Vice-Consul Captain Henry Lionel Galway (1859–1949) tried to negotiate a trade agreement with Oba Ovọnramwẹn Nọgbaisi (1888–1914) to allow for the free passage of goods through his territory and the development of the palm oil industry. Captain Gallwey (as his name was then spelled) pushed for British interests in the region, especially of the palm oil industry, by attempting to negotiate a free trade agreement with the Oba at the time. Later, Ralph Moor urged the Foreign Office to use whatever means to secure the signed treaty, up to and including force. Gallwey signed the treaty with the Oba and his chiefs which gave Britain legal justification for exerting greater influence in the region. The Oba was hesitant to sign the treaty. After the British consul Richard Burton visited Benin in 1862 he described it a place of ""gratuitous barbarity which stinks of death"", a narrative which was publicized in Britain and increased pressure for the territory's incorporation into the British Empire. The treaty itself does not explicitly mention anything about the ""bloody customs"" that Burton had written about, and instead includes a vague clause about ensuring ""the general progress of civilization"". While the treaty granted free trade to British merchants operating in the Kingdom of Benin, the Oba persisted in requiring customs duties. Since Major (later Sir) Claude Maxwell Macdonald, the Consul General of the Oil River Protectorate authorities considered the treaty legal and binding, he deemed the Oba's requirements a violation of the accord and thus a hostile act.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin,Benin,Benin Empire bronzes,"Benin,[a] officially the Republic of Benin,[b] is a country in West Africa. It was formerly known as Dahomey. It is bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, Burkina Faso to the north-west, and Niger to the north-east. The majority of its population lives on the southern coastline of the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The capital is Porto-Novo, and the seat of government is in Cotonou, the most populous city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 112,622 km2 (43,484 sq mi), and its population in 2021 was estimated to be approximately 13 million. It is a tropical country with an economy heavily dependent on agriculture and is an exporter of palm oil and cotton. From the 17th to the 19th century, political entities in the area included the Kingdom of Dahomey, the city-state of Porto Novo, and other states to the north. This region was referred to as the Slave Coast of West Africa from the early 17th century due to the high number of people who were sold and trafficked during the Atlantic slave trade to the New World. France took over the territory in 1894, incorporating it into French West Africa as French Dahomey. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. As a sovereign state, Benin has had democratic governments, military coups, and military governments. A self-described Marxist–Leninist state called the People's Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the multi-party Republic of Benin. The official language of Benin is French, with indigenous languages such as Fon, Bariba, Yoruba and Dendi also spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is Christianity (52.2%), followed by Islam (24.6%) and African Traditional Religions (17.9%). Benin is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Francophonie, the Community of Sahel–Saharan States, the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority. During French colonial rule and after independence on 1 August 1960, the country was named Dahomey, after the Kingdom of Dahomey. On 30 November 1975, following a Marxist–Leninist military coup, the country was renamed Benin, after the Bight of Benin, which borders the country, due to Dahomey only being associated with the Fon who inhabited the southern half of the country.

It ranks as the fourth-most populous city in Nigeria, according to the 2006 national census, preceded by Lagos, Kano, and Ibadan. Benin City is located in close proximity to the Benin River, situated approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) to the north, whilst its eastern perimeter lies 320 kilometres (200 mi) from Lagos via the arterial road network. The city's municipal boundaries converge with those of several prominent neighbouring towns in southern Nigeria, notably Agbor, Oghara, and Ekpoma.[citation needed] Benin City boasts an exceptionally fertile agricultural landscape and serves as the epicentre of Nigeria's thriving rubber industry. Additionally, the production of palm oil constitutes a substantial sector, further underscoring the city's prominence in Nigeria's agricultural economy. The city of Benin served as the paramount settlement of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, a pre-colonial polity that flourished from the 13th to the 19th centuries. During its final centuries, the kingdom maintained significant trade relations with Portugal, prior to being captured, sacked, and razed in 1897 by a British punitive expedition. This expedition resulted in the looting of numerous bronze sculptures from the Benin City palace, collectively referred to as the Benin Bronzes. Subsequent to their punitive victory, the British gradually colonized the area, eventually incorporating the region into Colonial Nigeria.",Benin City | Populated places in Edo State | State capitals in Nigeria | Cities in Nigeria | Sacred sites in traditional African religions,"1897, 2006",Geography | Agriculture | Trade | History | Edo people | European contact and colonization | British conquest and its aftermath | The Benin Bronzes and the legacy of colonialism,Country: Nigeria,1529,2025-06-22 19:36:04

A concept album, Cowboy Carter is the second of a planned trilogy of albums, following Renaissance (2022). Beyoncé conceived Cowboy Carter as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, spotlighting the overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history. Variously classified as a country pop, country, western, and Americana album, Cowboy Carter blends together diverse Southern sub-genres that Beyoncé listened to when growing up in Texas, including zydeco, rock and roll, folk, rhythm and blues, psychedelic soul and bluegrass. Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast, with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature rising Black country artists such as Shaboozey, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Gary Clark Jr., Adam Granduciel, Robert Randolph, Jon Batiste, and Rhiannon Giddens. Cowboy Carter was met with universal acclaim and appeared on multiple year-end lists; critics felt that the album's genre experimentation, expansive scope and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of their Black roots. The album increased the listenership of country music, drove cultural conversations on Black musicians' place within the genre, boosted the careers of rising country artists, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture. Cowboy Carter received eleven nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, becoming the third-most nominated album in Grammy history. It won Best Country Duo/Group Performance (for ""II Most Wanted""), Best Country Album and Album of the Year. Beyoncé is the first Black artist to win the former, and the first Black woman since Lauryn Hill in 1999 to win the latter. Cowboy Carter debuted at number one in several countries and broke multiple chart and streaming records. In the United States, Cowboy Carter became Beyoncé's eighth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the first album by a Black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart.

It is the eighth track on her eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter (2024), which was released on March 29, 2024, through Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records as an album track. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, becoming Beyoncé's third nomination in the category. The line ‘Sometimes I hold you closer just to know you’re real’ is one of my favorite lines I wrote for the whole record. Melody and lyric together can make something feel so much more beautiful. I think that melody, the way she sings it, and the line itself feels cute and intimate. I love that part of the song. The song was written by Beyoncé herself with Elizabeth Lowell Boland, Shawntoni Ajanae Nichols, Leven Kali, Ryan Beatty and Raphael Saadiq, who also produced the song. Critics described the song as a country pop, with elements form R&B and soft rock, with music influence from British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. The song received positive reviews by critics among the album release and was considered one of the best song of 2024. Michael Cragg of The Guardian defined the song ""excellent"" witch ""unspools like a lost Fleetwood Mac classic, all rippling 70s soft-rock melodies"". Chelsey Sanchez of Harper's Bazaar described the song as ""a bouncy dance anthem that illustrates her desire to protect and care for her lover"". Dan Rys, ranking the best songs of 2024 for Billboard, wrote that ""Bodyguard"" is ""maybe musically the simplest though also the most engaging"" song of the album, in wich ""Beyoncé's vocals really begin to soar, which elevates the song beyond what it could have been in anyone else’s hands"".",2024 songs | Beyoncé songs | Song recordings produced by Raphael Saadiq | Songs written by Beyoncé | Songs written by Raphael Saadiq | American soft rock songs | Country pop songs,2024,Composition | Critical reception | Promo video | Commercial performance | Live Performances | Accolades | Charts | Certifications,"Released: June 6, 2025 | Studio: The Sound Factory (Los Angeles, CA)[1]

It was written and produced by Beyoncé and Boots. Conceived by the latter following an infuriating meeting with a record label, the song was presented to Beyoncé who decided to record it following similar experiences in the music industry. The song was inspired by the works of English musician Aphex Twin and contains a stream of consciousness rap. Musically, it consists of two parts titled ""Ghost"" and ""Haunted"". It contains a minimalistic sound with keyboards, bass and percussion. Beyoncé raps the spoken word segment of ""Ghost"" with robotic and reverbed vocals. Lyrically, ""Haunted"" contains sexually explicit and frank lyrics talking about desire. Many music critics compared its sound with various artists and noted different influences and elements explored in its composition. Upon its release, the song was met with positive reviews, with critics praising its experimental sound and minimalistic approach. Two accompanying music videos were filmed for both parts of the song and placed separately on the visual album. The clip for ""Ghost"" was directed by Pierre Debusschere while Jonas Åkerlund served as the director for the second part, ""Haunted"". The former visual shows various close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the lyrics, while the latter features her walking in the corridor of a big mansion meeting various actors seen inside the rooms. Critics compared the video of ""Haunted"" and the singer's look with works by Madonna, most notably with her song ""Justify My Love"" (1990). The song was performed live during the last European leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and at the On the Run Tour in 2014. Beyoncé also performed it at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards as part of a medley consisting of songs from her fifth studio album. The things people say in those meetings would take your breath away. After a while, I didn't even feel like I was talking to people anymore, I was just talking to chairs. So I went home, it was five in the morning, and I just started typing shit out—everything I hear on the radio isn't inspiring; I'm not inspired by anything I'm doing; these people have no idea what's happening. It was just a stream-of-consciousness. I woke up the next day and realized I needed to do something with that.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday,Billie Holiday,Billie Holiday,"Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer. Nicknamed ""Lady Day"" by her friend and music partner, Lester Young, Holiday made significant contributions to jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly influenced by jazz instrumentalists, inspired a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Holiday was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills. After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem where she was heard by producer John Hammond, who liked her voice. Holiday signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Her collaboration with Teddy Wilson produced the hit ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. However, by the late 1940s, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, Holiday performed a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s, with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Because of personal struggles and an altered voice, Holiday's final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, Lady in Satin, was released in 1958. Holiday died of heart failure on July 17, 1959, at age 44. Holiday won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. In 2000, Holiday was also inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence; their website states that ""Billie Holiday changed jazz forever"". She was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR and was ranked fourth on the Rolling Stone list of ""200 Greatest Singers of All Time"" (2023). Several films about Holiday's life have been released, most recently The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021). Eleanora Fagan was born on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia to African American unwed teenage couple Clarence Halliday and Sarah Julia ""Sadie"" Fagan (née Harris). Her mother moved to Philadelphia at age 19, after being evicted from her parents' home in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, for becoming pregnant. With no support from her parents, Sarah made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Holiday to stay with her in Baltimore.",Billie Holiday | 1915 births | 1959 deaths | 20th-century African-American women singers | 20th-century American women singers | 20th-century American singers | African-American women singer-songwriters | American women singer-songwriters,"1958, 1959, 1915, 1935, 2023, 2000, 2021","Life and career | 1915–1929: Childhood | 1929–1935: Early career | 1935–1938: Recordings with Teddy Wilson | 1937–1938: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw | 1939: ""Strange Fruit"" and Commodore Records | 1940–1947: Commercial success | 1947–1952: Legal issues and Carnegie Hall concert","Born: Eleanora Fagan(1915-04-07)April 7, 1915Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. | Died: July 17, 1959(1959-07-17) (aged 44)New York City, U.S. | Resting place: Saint Raymond's Cemetery | Other names: Lady Day | Occupation: Singer | Years active: c. 1930–1959",2465,2025-06-22 19:37:29

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Arts_Movement,Black Arts Movement,Black Arts Movement,"The Black Arts Movement (BAM) was an African-American-led art movement that was active during the 1960s and 1970s. Through activism and art, BAM created new cultural institutions and conveyed a message of black pride. The movement expanded from the accomplishments of artists of the Harlem Renaissance. Famously referred to by Larry Neal as the ""aesthetic and spiritual sister of Black Power"", BAM applied these same political ideas to art and literature. and artists found new inspiration in their African heritage as a way to present the black experience in America. Artists such as Aaron Douglas, Hale Woodruff, and Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller pioneered the movement with a distinctly modernist aesthetic. This style influenced the proliferation of African American art during the twentieth century. The poet and playwright Amiri Baraka is widely recognized as the founder of BAM. In 1965, he established the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School (BART/S) in Harlem. Baraka's example inspired many others to create organizations across the United States. While many of these organizations were short-lived, their work has had a lasting influence. Some still exist, including the National Black Theatre, founded by Barbara Ann Teer in Harlem, New York. African Americans had always made valuable artistic contributions to American culture. However, due to the brutalities of slavery and the systemic racism of Jim Crow, these contributions often went unrecognized. Despite continued oppression, African-American artists continued to create literature and art that would reflect their experiences. A high-point for these artists was the Harlem Renaissance—a literary era that spotlighted black people. Many parallels can be made between the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement. The link is so strong that some scholars refer to the Black Arts Movement era as the Second Renaissance. One sees this connection clearly when reading Langston Hughes's The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain (1926). Hughes's seminal essay advocates that black writers resist external attempts to control their art, arguing instead that the ""truly great"" black artist will be the one who can fully embrace and freely express his blackness.",Black Arts Movement | 1964 introductions | 20th-century American literature | 20th-century art movements | African and Black nationalism | African-American poets | American art movements | American literary movements,"1965, 1926",Background | Harlem Renaissance | Civil rights movement | Developments | Authors | Locations | The Black Aesthetic | Major works,"Years active: 1965–1975 (approx.)[1] | Location: United States | Major figures: Amiri Baraka[1]

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_power_movement,Black power movement,Black Arts Movement,"The Black power movement or Black liberation movement emerged in the mid-1960s from the mainstream civil rights movement in the United States, reacting against its moderate and incremental tendencies and representing the demand for more immediate action to counter White supremacy. Many of its ideas were influenced by Malcolm X's criticism of Martin Luther King Jr.'s peaceful protest methods. The 1965 assassination of Malcolm X, coupled with the urban riots of 1964 and 1965, ignited the movement. While thinkers such as Malcolm X influenced the early movement, the views of the Black Panther Party, founded in 1966, are widely seen as the cornerstone. Black power was influenced by philosophies such as pan-Africanism, Black nationalism, and socialism, as well as contemporary events such as the Cuban Revolution and the decolonization of Africa. During the peak of the Black power movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many African Americans adopted ""Afro"" hairstyles, African clothes, or African names (such as Stokely Carmichael, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who popularized the phrase ""Black power"" and later changed his name to Kwame Ture) to emphasize their identity. Others founded Black-owned stores, food cooperatives, bookstores, publishers, media, clinics, schools, and other organizations oriented to their communities. American universities began to offer courses in Black studies, and the word Black replaced negro as the preferred usage in the country. Other leaders of the movement included Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, founders of the Black Panther Party. Some Black power organizations prioritized social programs, while others adopted a more militant approach; for instance, the Black Panther Party introduced a Free Breakfast for Children program and established community health clinics, while the Black Liberation Army carried out bombings and murdered police officers. The movement never had a central authority or structure, and its influence was diluted by legislation such as the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the expansion of federally funded welfare programs, and police action against its activists. The Black power movement declined by the mid-1970s and 1980s, as civil rights activists increasingly focused on electing Black politicians over militant struggle, though its legacy has influenced later movements, such as Black Lives Matter. The first popular use of the term ""Black power"" as a social and racial slogan was by Sto",Black Power | African-American cultural history | Counterculture of the 1960s | Counterculture of the 1970s | Counterculture of the 1980s | Guerrilla wars | Social movements in the United States | Rebellions in the United States,"1966, 1964, 1965, 1968",History | Origin | Escalation in the late 1960s | Peak in the early 1970s | De-escalation in the late 1970s | Decline in the 1980s | Characteristics | Education,"Date: 1966–1980s | Location: United States | Caused by: Perceived failures of the civil rights movement

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_power,Black power,Black Arts Movement,"Black power is a political slogan and a name which is given to various associated ideologies which aim to achieve self-determination for black people. It is primarily, but not exclusively, used in the United States by black activists and other proponents of what the slogan entails. The black power movement was prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing racial pride and the creation of black political and cultural institutions to nurture, promote and advance what was seen by proponents of the movement as being the collective interests and values of black Americans. The basis of black power is various ideologies that aim at achieving self-determination for black people in the U.S., dictating that black Americans create their own identities despite being subjected to pre-existing societal factors. ""Black power"" in its original political sense expresses a range of political goals, from militant self-defense against racial oppression to the establishment of social institutions and a self-sufficient economy, including black-owned bookstores, cooperatives, farms, and media. However, the movement has been criticized for alienating itself from the mainstream civil rights movement, and its support of black separatism. The earliest known usage of the term ""black power"" is found in Richard Wright's 1954 book Black Power. On May 1, 1965, a few months after the February 21 assassination of Malcolm X, Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs created ""in our basement"" the national Organization for Black Power, along ""with former and then current members of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) and SNCC among its members,"" including ""representatives from Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York,"" as ""a coordinating group of grassroots activists that looked to establish a concrete program for black self-determination centered in the cities."" Already, ""in the spring of 1964, together with Max Stanford of Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM); Baltimore Afro-American reporter William Worthy, and Patricia Robinson of Third World Press,"" the Boggses had ""met with Malcolm in a Harlem luncheonette to discuss our proposal that he come to Detroit to help build the Organization for Black Power,"" but ""Malcolm’s response was that we should go ahead while he served the movement as an 'evangelist.'""

Initiated in reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts and the conditions in which they were produced, the movement flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920. Some consider that it is the root of the Modern Style, a British expression of what later came to be called the Art Nouveau movement. Others consider that it is the incarnation of Art Nouveau in England. Others consider Art and Crafts to be in opposition to Art Nouveau. Arts and Crafts indeed criticized Art Nouveau for its use of industrial materials such as iron. In Japan, it emerged in the 1920s as the Mingei movement. It stood for traditional craftsmanship, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was anti-industrial in its orientation. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.",Arts and Crafts movement | Architectural styles | Art movements | Arts in the United Kingdom | American art movements | British art | British art movements | Crafts,"1920, 1880",Origins and influences | Design reform | A.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art_by_African-American_artists,Abstract art by African-American artists,Black Arts Movement,"African-American artists have created various forms of abstract art in a wide range of mediums, including painting, sculpture, collage, drawing, graphics, ceramics, installation, mixed media, craft, and decorative arts, presenting the viewer with abstract expression, imagery, and ideas instead of representational imagery. Abstract art by African-American artists has been widely exhibited and studied. Many artists have claimed responsibility for creating the first piece of abstract art, given the ""non-representational"" and “non-objective"" subject matter of the work. Between November 1906 and March 1907, Hilma af Klint created a series of abstract paintings, ""Primordial Chaos"". In 1909, Francis Picabia painted ""Caoutchouc"". A year later, Wassily Kandinsky signed ""1910"" to one of his abstract watercolors, ""Composition VII"", although many researchers believe that the work was actually created in 1913; Kandinsky may have backdated his work to claim credit for being the first abstract artist in modern art history unaware of af Klint and Picabia's works. The first Black artist to be recognized for creating an abstract work is just as interesting; the challenge with the abstract work associated with black artists is that ""it did not announce itself as Black art."" Black abstract artists faced all of the same aesthetic, intellectual, and value questions that other abstract artists faced and also had to confront individual and institutional biases regarding content as it related to black abstract signals and symbols. Lowery Stokes Sims, the former president of Studio Museum in Harlem and the first Black curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proposed that abstraction originated from African art, and that Black artists are claiming their birthright through abstraction. The glaring omission of Black artists is evident throughout American art history. Many black artists felt marginalized in the white-dominated art world. Museum leaders and gallery owners were rarely interested in the work of Black artists. In the 1700s and 1800s, Black artists created work that did not reflect “the Black experience"" in their subject matter; they painted portraits of white families and sweeping landscapes of white owned lands as a way to make money as an artist, which could be interpreted as the “Black experience” for artists during this period. Black artists played a pivotal role in the growth of contemporary art of the 1920s to 1940s, yet they existed on the outskirts of the art wo",20th century in Harlem | 1970s in art | African and Black nationalism | African-American art | African-American arts organizations | African-American cultural history | African-American culture | American art movements,"1906, 1907, 1909, 1913, 1910",Black artists and abstract art | History | 1920s | 1930s | 1940s | 1950s | 1960s | 1970s,,3884,2025-06-22 19:40:35

Hazing is often cited as one of the most harmful aspects of fraternities and sororities and poses a major threat to their existence, drawing great criticism from educators and administrators. As fraternities and sororities are very diverse in their structures, regulations, governing entities, and memberships, and as hazing can take on many forms, the issue of hazing within these organizations is complex and multifaceted. While most educational institutions include hazing in their disciplinary procedures, definitions of hazing can vary substantially. The Fraternal Information & Programming Group (FIPG) defines hazing activities as: Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol, paddling in any form, creation of excessive fatigue, physical and psychological shocks, quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips, or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, engaging in public stunts and buffoonery, morally degrading or humiliating games and activities, and other activities which are not consistent with academic achievement, fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution or applicable state law.",Hazing | Fraternity and sorority culture,,Definitions | Problems in the quantitative analysis | Responses to hazing | Fraternity hazing characteristics | In popular culture | See also | Notes | References,,1653,2025-06-22 19:41:45
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_letter_society_effect_on_youth_identity,Greek letter society effect on youth identity,Black Greek letter organizations,"Greek letter society effect on youth identity happens at a time when students begin to explore and experiment to discover who they are. Greek letter societies include Greek letter organizations, sororities, fraternities, and Greek life. Members join while enrolled in tertiary education. These organizations primarily consist of solely all women or all men. A Greek letter society members share collective goals and understandings of the organization's requirements, rituals, and relationships. Membership in a fraternity or sorority generally focuses on undergraduate education, where many students begin to explore and experiment with different experiences, but it also requires a lifetime commitment to the organization. Greek letter societies, with their emphasis on member relations, provide a platform for members to create their own identity through the organization. Identity creation for those who are transitioning to a new chapter of their life, like undergraduate students, relies heavily on who you interact with and who you build relationships with. Greek letter organizations offer opportunities for incoming students to interact with, and create relationships with, diverse individuals to mold their identity. Greek letter societies also require a monetary commitment through the payment of initiation fees and dues, bringing a factor of privilege into the organizations. Being surrounded and bonded by others who also share, most likely, very similar classes, family situations, and financial commitments can affect how youths' identities are created in this transitional period. This causes more unanimity within the chapters, and Greek life as a whole, as only those who have the privilege to both attend secondary education and pay their organization's dues. In addition to class, racial factors within Greek letter organizations play a large role in how identity can be created. In conjunction with class, Greek life among college students in North America consists primarily of Caucasian members. Historically, certain chapters only accepted members of a particular race or heritage. This adds to the unanimity that class and privilege create, causing members to be only surrounded by those primarily of their lifestyle.",Fraternities and sororities | Fraternities and sororities in the United States | Student culture | Fraternity and sorority culture,,Greek life and relationship building | Bonds | Relationships in identity creation | Class and privilege | Monetary commitments | Class and identity creation | Race and culture | Black Greek letter organizations,,2242,2025-06-22 19:41:46

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month,Black History Month,Black History Month,"Black History Month is an annually observed commemorative month originating in the United States, where it is also known as African-American History Month. It began as a way of remembering important people and events in the history of the African diaspora, initially lasting a week before becoming a month-long observation since 1970. It is celebrated in February in the United States and Canada, where it has received official recognition from governments, and more recently has also been celebrated in Ireland and the United Kingdom where it is observed in October. The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH) announced the second week of February to be ""Negro History Week"". This week was chosen because it coincided with the birthday of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and that of Frederick Douglass on February 14, both of which Black communities had celebrated since the late 19th century. For example, in January 1897, school teacher Mary Church Terrell persuaded the Washington, D.C. school board to set aside the afternoon of Douglass's birthday as Douglass Day to teach about his life and work in the city's segregated public schools. The thought process behind the week was never recorded, but scholars acknowledge two reasons for its birth: recognition and importance. In 1915, Woodson had participated in the Lincoln Jubilee, a celebration of the 50 years since emancipation from slavery held in Bronzeville, Chicago. The summer-long Jubilee, which drew thousands of attendees from across the country to see exhibitions of heritage and culture, impressed Woodson with the need to draw organized focus to the history of black people. He led the founding of the ASNLH in Chicago that fall, toward the end of the Jubilee. Early in the event's history, African-American newspapers lent crucial support. From the event's initial phase, primary emphasis was placed on encouraging the coordinated teaching of the history of Black Americans in the nation's public schools. The first Negro History Week was met with a lukewarm response, gaining the cooperation of the departments of education of the states of North Carolina, Delaware, and West Virginia as well as the city school administrations of Baltimore, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Despite this limited observance, Woodson regarded the event as ""one of the most fortunate steps ever",1976 introductions | African-American events | Black British history | Commemorative months | February observances | History of Black people in Canada | Month-long observances | Observances in the United Kingdom,"1897, 1926, 1970, 1915",Origin | Negro History Week (1926) | Black History Month (1970) | Observance by region | United States | United Kingdom | Germany | Canada,"Also called: African-American History Month | Observed by: United States, Canada,[1] Ireland, United Kingdom[2] | Significance: Celebration of the African diaspora including, African-American history | Date: February (US, Canada and Jamaica)

As of 2022, LGBTQ History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to Australia, Canada, Cuba, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, Canada, Armenia, Romania, the Netherlands, Southeast Asia, and Australia, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on 11 October and to commemorate the first and second marches on Washington in 1979 and 1987 for LGBTQ rights. In the United Kingdom it is observed during February; in the UK this coincides with a major celebration of the 2003 abolition of Section 28. In Berlin, the capital of Germany, it is known as Queer History Month and is celebrated in May. In October 2016, Minus 18, Australian Queer Archives, and the Safe Schools Coalition Victoria organised the first Australian LGBTQ History Month.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln's_Birthday,Lincoln's Birthday,Black History Month,"Lincoln's Birthday is a public holiday in some U.S. states, observed on the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, California, Missouri, and New York observe the holiday. In many other states, Lincoln's birthday is not celebrated separately, as a stand-alone holiday. Instead, Lincoln's birthday is combined with a celebration of President George Washington's birthday (also in February) and celebrated either along with the Federal holiday of Washington's Birthday or as Presidents' Day on the third Monday in February. The earliest known observance of Lincoln's birthday occurred in Buffalo, New York, in either 1873 or 1874. Julius Francis (d. 1881), a Buffalo druggist, made it his life's mission to honor the slain president. He repeatedly petitioned Congress to establish Lincoln's birthday as a legal holiday. The day is marked by traditional wreath-laying ceremonies at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky, and at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The latter has been the site of a ceremony ever since the Memorial was dedicated. Since that event in 1922, observances continue to be organized by the Lincoln Birthday National Commemorative Committee and by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). A wreath is laid on behalf of the President of the United States, a custom also carried out at the grave sites of all deceased U.S. presidents on their birthdays. Lincoln's tomb is in Springfield, Illinois. On February 12, 2009, the annual wreath-laying ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial commemorated Lincoln's 200th birthday in grand fashion. An extended ceremony, organized by the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) and with help from MOLLUS, featured musical performances from four-time Grammy-nominated singer Michael Feinstein and the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The morning celebration also featured remarks by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin; Lincoln scholar and ALBC Co-chair Harold Holzer; recently retired Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice – and ALBC Commissioner – Frank J.

Celebrated during March in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, corresponding with International Women's Day on March 8, it is observed during October in Canada, corresponding with the celebration of Persons Day on October 18. A weeklong observance in Sonoma County, California, in 1978 was subsequently championed by Gerda Lerner and the National Women's History Alliance to be recognized as a national week (1980) and then month (1987) in the United States, spreading internationally after that. Women's History Month was first celebrated in Australia in 2000, initiated by Helen Leonard, convenor of the National Women's Media Centre, working with the Women's Electoral Lobby. The organisation of annual Women's History Month celebrations is incorporated as part of the work of the Australian Women's History Forum. Since 2005, the annual celebration of Women's History Month in Australia has centred on a different area of women's achievement. Promotional materials and events are focused around the theme and organisations, institutions and community groups are encouraged to use this theme for their own events. AWHF hosted Women's ""History Month Finale: The Great Debate 2014"", marking the end of its official commemorations. Women's History Month was proclaimed in Canada in 1992, where its purpose is to give Canadians ""an opportunity to learn about the important contributions of women and girls to our society – and to the quality of our lives today"". October was chosen to coincide with the celebration of the anniversary on October 18 of the decision of the court case Edwards v.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter,Black Lives Matter,Black Lives Matter movement,"Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized political and social movement that aims to highlight racism, discrimination and racial inequality experienced by black people, and to promote anti-racism. Its primary concerns are police brutality and racially motivated violence against black people. The movement began in response to the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Rekia Boyd, among others. BLM and its related organizations typically advocate for various policy changes related to black liberation and criminal justice reform. While there are specific organizations that label themselves ""Black Lives Matter"", such as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the overall movement is a decentralized network with no formal hierarchy. As of 2021[update], there are about 40 chapters in the United States and Canada. The slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" itself has not been trademarked by any group. In 2013, activists and friends Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Ayọ Tometi originated the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two more African Americans, Michael Brown—resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri—and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The movement gained international attention during global protests in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. An estimated 15 to 26 million people participated in Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, making it one of the largest protest movements in the country's history. Despite being characterized by opponents as violent, the overwhelming majority of BLM demonstrations have been peaceful. The popularity of Black Lives Matter has shifted over time, largely due to changing perceptions among white Americans. In 2020, 67% of adults in the United States expressed support for the movement, declining to 51% of U.S. adults in 2023. Support among people of color has, however, held strong, with 81% of African Americans, 61% of Hispanics a",Black Lives Matter | 21st-century social movements | 2010s controversies in the United States | 2020s controversies in the United States | 2013 establishments in the United States | African Americans' rights organizations | American political catchphrases | Anti-black racism in the United States,"2014, 2016, 2023, 2020, 2015, 2021, 2013","Structure and organization | Decentralization | Broader movement | Funding | Strategies and tactics | Internet and social media | Direct action | Media, music and other cultural impacts","Date: 2013–present | Location: International, largely in the United States | Also known as: Black Lives Matter movementBLM | Cause: Racial discrimination and police brutality against black people | Motive: Anti-racism | Outcome: Multiple mass protests in the United States

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter,All Lives Matter,Black Lives Matter movement,"All Lives Matter is a slogan that emerged as a negative response to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, initially popularized on social media following the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014. The phrase has been widely criticized as denying that police violence and discrimination disproportionately affect Black Americans, or that it misinterprets ""Black Lives Matter"" as not a recognition of that disproportionate treatment but as meaning other lives mean less. The slogan received increased attention when used by several high-profile Republican politicians during the 2016 US presidential election, as well as some Democrats who were criticized for it. The All Lives Matter movement was created as a negative response to the Black Lives Matter movement. The use of the All Lives Matter slogan on Twitter following the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner began in 2014 and was used to deny recognition of racial violence against African Americans, and spread as a conservative rejection of the Black Live Matter movement's acknowledgement of police brutality and ethnic violence. Some supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement adopted the All Lives Matter slogan to shift debate away from semantics, while others avoided the term entirely. The All Lives Matter slogan gained prominence in national American politics during the 2016 United States presidential election. In June 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton faced backlash after using the phrase ""all lives matter"" at an African-American church in Missouri during her presidential campaign. Martin O'Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, was booed when he said: ""White lives matter. All lives matter."" Several Republican candidates supported the All Lives Matter movement in the 2016 presidential election. Donald Trump said ""All lives matter"" at one of his rallies, and claimed that ""Black Lives Matter"" is a divisive and racist term. United States Republican Senator Tim Scott has used the term when calling for racial equality and unity. Ben Carson, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Donald Trump, is a proponent of All Lives Matter, as is Senator Rand Paul, who has claimed that Black Lives Matter ""focused on the wrong targets"". Paul stated that ""I think they should change their name maybe—if they were All Lives Matter, or Innocent Lives Matter."" Other Republican supporters include Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani.

The organization is often mistaken for other organizations within the Black Lives Matter movement because it often solely employs the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" as its name and it also owns the domain name ""blacklivesmatter.com"" as its official website. In 2015, BLMGN was the largest and most well-funded organization within the broader Black Lives Matter social movement, and it claims to speak on behalf of the movement. Efforts which were started in late 2020 by its then Executive Director Patrisse Cullors began to centralize its operations. The organization was founded in 2013 by three female activists. International but largely based in the United States, the organization advocates for the eradication of systematic racism and the prevention of police violence. Among its core beliefs is that the entire US legal system, mainstream media, and society is inherently white supremacist; and that ""policing at-large is an irredeemable institution"" and should be defunded. The organization has been criticized for its statements in support of Marxism, its handling of its finances, and for using its influence with media platforms to suppress negative stories about itself and investigating journalists who publish such stories. The BLMGNF has also been accused of long-term financial mismanagement such as the purchase of mansions, providing lucrative contracts to companies owned by relatives of its founders and a lack of transparency in their fundraisers. The organization exists as a decentralized network of local-based chapters. According to its website as of August 2022[update], there are over 40 chapters. Each local chapter is expected to embrace the set principles of the BLMGN, but it is allowed to internally organize itself in any way it pleases. Each chapter can form its own agenda, so some chapters are more radical than others. Local chapters are mostly funded via direct donations, but they can also apply for more funding from the BLMGN.",Black Lives Matter | African Americans' rights organizations | Anti-racist organizations in the United States | Organizations established in 2013 | 2013 establishments in the United States | Civil rights organizations | 501(c)(3) organizations | Lobbying organizations in the United States,"2015, 2022, 2013, 2020",Organization | Black Lives Matter Political Action Committee | Black Lives Matter Grassroots | History | Formation | Early activities | George Floyd protests and subsequent growth | Criticism and disputes,"Formation: 2013 | Founders: Alicia GarzaPatrisse CullorsAyọ Tometi | Type: 501(c)(3) organization | Tax ID no.: 82-4862489 | Purpose: Advocacy and protests against racial discrimination[1]Government lobbying[2][3] | Location: International, largely in the United States | Key people: Patrisse Cullors (former executive director)",2142,2025-06-22 19:39:07
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter,Blue Lives Matter,Black Lives Matter movement,"Blue Lives Matter (also known as Police Lives Matter) is a countermovement in the United States that aims to show solidarity with law enforcement. It emerged in 2014 in direct opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement and gained traction following the high-profile homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York. Supporters of Blue Lives Matter have called for crimes committed against police officers to be classified as hate crimes. Critics have said that, while being Black is an inherent characteristic, being a police officer is a choice, and that police officers are already respected in most communities. They add that attacking or killing a police officer already carries a higher penalty than attacking a non-police officer in most states. On December 20, 2014, in the wake of the killings of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, a group of law enforcement officers formed Blue Lives Matter to counter media reports that they perceived to be anti-police. Blue Lives Matter is made up of active and retired law enforcement officers.

Members include the Black Lives Matter Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. They are endorsed by groups such as Color of Change, Race Forward, Brooklyn Movement Center, PolicyLink, Million Women March Cleveland, and ONE DC, and the coalition receives communications and tactical support from an organization named Blackbird. On July 24, 2015 the movement first convened at Cleveland State University where between 1,500 and 2,000 activists gathered to participate in open discussions and demonstrations. The conference initially attempted to ""strategize ways for the Movement for Black Lives to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions on a national level"". However, the conference resulted in the formation of a much more significant social movement. At the end of the three day conference, on July 26, the Movement for Black Lives initiated a year long ""process of convening local and national groups to create a United Front"". This year long process ultimately resulted in the establishment of an organizational platform that articulates the goals, demands, and policies for which the Movement for Black Lives supports in order to achieve the ""liberation"" of black communities across America. Following the murder of George Floyd, M4BL released the BREATHE Act, which called for sweeping legislative changes surrounding policing. The policy bill included calls to divest from policing and reinvest funds directly into community resources and alternative emergency response models. In 2020, the Movement for Black Lives released policy demands in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) has established formal partnerships with over 50 organizations across 12 countries, including Brazil's Movimento Negro Unificado and South Africa's Abahlali baseMjondolo shack dwellers' movement. These alliances facilitated the 2021 Global Black Lives Matter protests, where activists in Johannesburg and Rio de Janeiro adapted M4BL's ""Defund the Police"" demands to local contexts.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party,Black Panther Party,Black Panther Party,"The Black Panther Party (originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense) was a Marxist–Leninist and black power political organization founded by college students Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in October 1966 in Oakland, California. The party was active in the United States between 1966 and 1982, with chapters in many major American cities, including San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Philadelphia. They were also active in many prisons and had international chapters in the United Kingdom and Algeria. Upon its inception, the party's core practice was its open carry patrols (""copwatching"") designed to challenge the excessive force and misconduct of the Oakland Police Department. From 1969 onward, the party created social programs, including the Free Breakfast for Children Programs, education programs, and community health clinics. The Black Panther Party advocated for class struggle, claiming to represent the proletarian vanguard. In 1969, J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), described the party as ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country."" The FBI sabotaged the party with an illegal and covert counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) of surveillance, infiltration, perjury, and police harassment, all designed to undermine and criminalize the party. The FBI was involved in the 1969 assassinations of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, who were killed in a raid by the Chicago Police Department. Black Panther Party members were involved in many fatal firefights with police. Huey Newton allegedly killed officer John Frey in 1967, and Eldridge Cleaver (Minister of Information) led an ambush in 1968 of Oakland police officers, in which two officers were wounded and Panther treasurer Bobby Hutton was killed. The party suffered many internal conflicts, resulting in the murder of Alex Rackley. Government persecution initially contributed to the party's growth among African Americans and the political left, who both valued the party as a powerful force against de facto segregation and the US military draft during the Vietnam War. Party membership peaked in 1970 and gradually declined over the next decade, due to vilification by the mainstream press and infighting largely fomented by COINTELPRO. Support further declined over reports of the party's alleged criminal activities, such as drug dealing and extortion. The party's legacy is controversial.

Despite its name, the NBPP is not an official successor to the Black Panther Party. Members of the original Black Panther Party have insisted that the new party has no legitimacy and that ""there is no new Black Panther Party"". The group is characterized by it's departure away from many of the socialist ideals of it's namesake, and towards New-Afrikanism. The Southern Poverty Law Center, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights consider the NBPP to be a hate group, accusing the organization and its leaders of racism and antisemitism. The NBPP traces its origins to the Black Panther Militia created in 1990 by original Panther Michael McGee in Milwaukee. However, as McGee expanded his organization, it later came under the control of Aaron Michaels in Dallas. In turn, Aaron Michaels lost control of the leadership of the group to Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former leading member of the Nation of Islam, who proceeded to fill the ranks of the New Panthers with ex-Nation of Islam members and other Black Muslims. Under Muhammad and his successors' leadership, the New Panthers shifted radically from the ideology of the original Black Panther Party towards an extremist form of Black nationalism. The NBPP is currently led by Krystal Muhammad. Malik Zulu Shabazz announced on an October 14, 2013 online radio broadcast that he was stepping down and that Hashim Nzinga, then national chief of staff, would replace him. This move created a schism within the group. A vote was held and Krystal Muhammad was elected leader of the group.

The Ten-Point Program is a set of guidelines to the Black Panther Party that states their ideals and ways of operation, a ""combination of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence"". The document was created in 1966 by the founders of the Black Panther Party, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, whose political thoughts lay within the realm of Marxism and Black Nationalism. Each one of the statements were put in place for all of the Black Panther Party members to live by and actively practice every day. The Ten-Point program was released on May 15, 1967, in the second issue of the party's weekly newspaper, The Black Panther. All succeeding 537 issues contained the program, titled ""What We Want Now!."" The Ten Point Program comprised two sections: The first, titled ""What We Want Now!"" described what the Black Panther Party wants from the leaders of American Society. The second section, titled ""What We Believe,"" outlines the philosophical views of the party and the rights that African Americans should have, but are denied. It is structured similarly to the United States Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. ""What We Believe"" expands on the first section, making demands of what will be deemed sufficient payment for the injustices committed against the Black Community. For example, one section states that, ""We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules was promised 100 years ago as a restitution for slave labor and mass murder of black people"". It continues to state that ""We will accept this payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities.""

The counterculture era group took the name and dedicated its energies to ""cultural revolution.” John Sinclair made every effort to ensure that the White Panthers were not mistaken for a white supremacist group, responding to such claims with ""quite the contrary."" The party worked with many ethnic minority rights groups in the Rainbow Coalition. The group was most active in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan, and included the proto-punk band MC5, which John Sinclair managed for several years before he was incarcerated. From a general ideological perspective, Plamondon and Sinclair[which?] defined the White Panthers as ""fighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners."" The White Panthers added other elements such as advocating ""rock 'n roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism."" Yippie co-founder Abbie Hoffman praised the WPP in Steal This Book and Woodstock Nation, and John Sinclair often referred to himself as a Yippie as well. The group emerged from the Detroit Artists Workshop, a radical arts collective founded in 1964 near Wayne State University. Among its concerns was the legalization of marijuana; John Sinclair had several arrests for possession. It aligned itself with radical politics, claiming the 12th Street Riot was justifiable under political and economic conditions in Detroit. Plamondon was indicted with John Sinclair in connection to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor on September 29, 1968, a year after the founding of the group. Upon hearing on the left-wing alternative radio station WABX that he had been indicted, he fled the U.S. for Europe and Africa, spending time in Algeria with exiled Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver. After secretly re-entering the country, and on his way to a safe house in northern Michigan, he was arrested in a routine traffic stop, joining John Sinclair, who had been sentenced to nine and a half years in jail for violating Michigan's marijuana possession laws, in prison. Plamondon was convicted and was in prison when Sinclair was released on bond in 1971 while appeals were being heard on his ",1960s in Detroit | 1970s in Detroit | 1980s in Detroit | Allies (social justice) | Anti-fascist organizations in the United States | Anti-racist organizations in the United States | Black Panther Party | Black Power,"1964, 1968, 1971",Michigan years | Legal reforms | Portland | San Francisco | United Kingdom | White Panther Statement | See also | Notes,"Founded: November 1, 1968 | Dissolved: c. 1980s | Ideology: Anti-racismAnti-capitalism | Political position: Far-left | National affiliation: Rainbow Coalition",2724,2025-06-22 19:39:27

Feminista Jones described it in Salon as ""a collective of active, primarily African-American Twitter users who have created a virtual community proving adept at bringing about a wide range of sociopolitical changes."" A similar Black Twitter community arose in South Africa in the early 2010s. According to a 2013 report by the Pew Research Center, 28 percent of African Americans who had used the Internet also used X (then referred to as Twitter), compared to 20 percent of online white, non-Hispanic Americans. By 2018, this gap had shrunk, with 26 percent of all African American adults using Twitter, compared to 24 percent of white adults and 20 percent of Hispanic adults. In addition, in 2013, 11 percent of African-American Twitter users said they used Twitter at least once a day, compared to 3 percent of white users. BlackTwitter.com was launched as a news aggregator reflective of black culture in 2020.[citation needed] User and social media researcher André Brock dates the first published comments on Black Twitter usage to a 2008 piece by blogger Anil Dash, and a 2009 article by Chris Wilson in The Root describing the viral success of Twitter memes such as #YouKnowYoureBlackWhen and #YouKnowYoureFromQueens that were primarily aimed at Black Twitter users.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter,Twitter,Black Twitter culture,"Twitter, officially known as X since 2023, is an American microblogging and social networking service. It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and one of the most-visited websites. Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts commonly known as ""tweets"" (officially ""posts"") and like other users' content. The platform also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, a chatbot (Grok), job search, and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets. Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world. A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023. 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans. The service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation and hate speech. Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer. In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to ""X"" and the bird logo would be retired, a process which was completed by May 2024. Since Musk's takeover, data from app-tracking firms has shown that global usage of Twitter has declined by approximately 15%, compared to a decline of 5–10% in some other social media sites.

It is known for using particular terminology and for incidents of harassment. Discussions in Stan Twitter spaces often revolve around public figures – primarily those in the entertainment industry. Stan Twitter can also be found to support political views. The origin of the term stan is often credited to the 2000 song ""Stan"", about an obsessed fan, by American rapper Eminem featuring British singer Dido. The word itself was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017 with the definition ""an overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular celebrity”. The term was originally a noun, but over time evolved and began to be used as a verb as well. Stan Twitter has been noted by The Atlantic as one of the ""tribes"" of Twitter. Polygon has described Stan Twitter as ""an overarching collection of various fandoms"", and additionally as a community that ""[signifies] individuals congregated around certain, specific interests ranging from queer identity to K-pop groups, and added that ""Stan Twitter is essentially synonymous with fandom twitter."" The Daily Dot wrote that ""Stan Twitter is essentially a community of Extremely Online like-minded individuals who discuss their various fandoms and what they 'stan'.""

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board responded with a ""poison pill"" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech, framing the acquisition as the cornerstone of X, an ""everything app"". In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to ""extremely hardcore"" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X. Reactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sermonic_tradition,Black sermonic tradition,Black church tradition,"The Black sermonic tradition, or Black preaching tradition, is an approach to sermon (or homily) construction and delivery practiced primarily among African Americans in the Black Church. The tradition seeks to preach messages that appeal to both the intellect and the emotive dimensions of humanity. The tradition finds its roots in the painful experiences of blacks during slavery in the United States, as well as experiences during the Jim Crow era and subsequent discrimination. Scholars and practitioners have widely recognized four elements of the tradition, which widely continue to the modern day. Firstly, the preaching emphasizes the preacher's freedom to be his or her authentic black self and not have to front a false persona or group identity via code switching. Secondly, the preaching is characterized by a variety of rhetorical embellishments including often jarring hyperbole, corresponding body language, and musicality in vocalizations. Thirdly, it is often marked by challenges to dominant societal structures and emphasizes how individuals may be transformed by having a relationship with God. Finally, there is a recognition of historical continuity with ancestors and their struggles. Some African American poetry and other literature is organized by the pattern of the sermonic tradition. Raboteau describes a common style of black preaching called ""whooping"", which first developed in the early 19th century, and became common throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries:",African-American Christianity | Black studies | Sermons,,Aspects | Whooping | See also | References | External links,,1501,2025-06-22 19:41:34
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church,Black church,Black church tradition,"The Black church (sometimes termed Black Christianity or African American Christianity) is the faith and body of Christian denominations and congregations in the United States that predominantly minister to, and are led by, African Americans, as well as these churches' collective traditions and members. Black churches primarily arose in the 19th century, during a time when race-based slavery and racial segregation were both commonly practiced in the United States. Black people generally searched for an area where they could independently express their faith, find leadership, and escape from inferior treatment in white dominated churches. Throughout many African American houses, churches reflect a deep cultural emphasis on community and shared spiritual experience. For African Americans, the church is a dynamic, living body of believers whose collective faith and fellowship are central, regardless of the physical space. This difference highlights the unique cultural and historical significance that the African American community places on the act of gathering and the people themselves, rather than the location. The number of Black churches in the United States is substantial. According to the Pew Research Center in 2005, there were approximately 25,000 Black churches across the country, encompassing a wide range of denominations and independent congregations. A majority of African American congregations are affiliated with Protestant denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), or the National Baptist Convention and related churches, some of them are affiliated with predominantly white Protestant denominations such as the United Church of Christ (which developed from the Congregational Church of New England), integrated denominations such as the Church of God, others are independent congregations.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_tradition,Christian tradition,Black church tradition,"Christian tradition is a collection of traditions consisting of practices or beliefs associated with Christianity. Many churches have traditional practices, such as particular patterns of worship or rites, that developed over time. Deviations from such patterns are sometimes considered unacceptable by followers, or are regarded as heretical. There are certain Christian traditions that are practiced throughout the liturgical year, such as praying a daily devotional during Advent, erecting a nativity scene during Christmastide, chalking the door on Epiphany Day, fasting during Lent, waving palms on Palm Sunday, eating easter eggs during Eastertide, and decorating the church in red on Pentecost. Tradition also includes historic teaching of the recognized church authorities, such as Church Councils and ecclesiastical officials (e.g., the Pope, Patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop of Canterbury, etc.), and includes the teaching of significant individuals like the Church Fathers, the Protestant Reformers, and the founders of denominations. Many creeds, confessions of faith, and catechisms generated by these bodies are also part of the traditions of various bodies. The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Persian churches distinguish between what is called Apostolic or sacred tradition and ecclesiastical traditions. In the course of time ecclesial traditions develop in theology, discipline, liturgy, and devotions. These the Church may retain, modify or even abandon. Apostolic tradition, on the other hand, is the teaching that was handed down by the Apostles by word of mouth, by their example and ""by the institutions they established"", among which is the apostolic succession of the bishops: ""this living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition"". ""And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God, which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit."" Prima scriptura is upheld by the Anglican and Methodist traditions, which teach that Scripture is the primary source for Christian doctrine, but that ""tradition, experience, and reason"" can subordinately inform Christian practice as long as they are in harmony with the Bible. In Methodism, sacred tradition refers to ""church's consensual interpretation of the Bible"" and in view of the prima scriptura perspective, informs doctrine, such as that regarding infant baptism for example, in which Methodist teaching appeals to Scripture chiefly, ",Christian terminology | Christian tradition,,Tradition and ecclesial traditions | Branches | See also | References | Bibliography,,2757,2025-06-22 19:41:35
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition,Tradition,Black church tradition,"A tradition is a system of beliefs or behaviors (folk custom) passed down within a group of people or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms and behaviors such as greetings, etc. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years— the word tradition itself derives from the Latin word tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether it be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. The phrase ""according to tradition"" or ""by tradition"" usually means that what follows is known only through oral tradition and is not supported (and might even be refuted) by solid evidence. Here, ""tradition"" describes the source or nature of the information. For example, ""According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other places have historically claimed him as theirs."" This tradition may never be proven or disproved. Another example is, ""King Arthur, according to history, a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."" Whether the claims are supported by evidence or not does not reduce their value as cultural history and literature. Traditions are subject of study in several academic fields of learning, especially in the humanities and social sciences, including anthropology, archaeology, history, and sociology. The conceptualization of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural ",Tradition | Political culture | Social agreement | Social philosophy | Sociological terminology,,Definition | Invention of tradition | In scholarly discourse | Anthropology | Archaeology | Biology | Musicology and ethnomusicology | Sociology,,2851,2025-06-22 19:41:36

The headquarters of the Progressive National Baptist Convention are in Washington, D.C. Part of the Black church tradition, since its organization, the denomination has member churches outside the United States, particularly in the Caribbean and Europe. It is a member of the National Council of Churches and the Baptist World Alliance. The Progressive National Baptist Convention formed in 1961 after civil-rights-oriented Baptist ministers led by L. Venchael Booth of Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati, failed to replace Joseph H. Jackson, the long-time head of the National Baptist Convention (NBC USA). The older group stood aloof from the civil rights movement which was often led by local Baptist ministers; the National Baptist Convention (NBC USA) often preached spiritual salvation rather than political activism. The dissidents nominated Gardner C. Taylor as president of the NBC USA. After a fist fight between reformers and conservatives, in which one elderly minister was accidentally killed, Jackson's supporters won. Martin Luther King was ousted from the NBC USA and his goal of using the united power of the black Baptist community to promote civil rights came to nothing. His defeat prompted the formation of the new predominantly African American Baptist denomination. Thirty-three delegates from 14 states gathered at Zion Baptist Church in Cincinnati to discuss the issue. The vote to organize passed by one vote. L. Venchael Booth, pastor of Zion Baptist in Cincinnati, was elected first president of the convention. The convention was originally formed as the ""Progressive Baptist Convention"" and the word ""National"" was added to the name in 1962. The convention has grown from the original founding numbers to member congregations throughout the United States, the Caribbean, Europe and Africa. Following a path of political activism, the Progressive National Baptist Convention supported groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and methods such as affirmative action. Famous civil rights leaders who were members of the PNBC include Martin Luther King Jr., Benjamin Mays, Ralph Abernathy, Wyatt Tee Walker, and Gardner C. Taylor.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues,Blues,Blues music history,"Blues is a music genre and musical form that originated among African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the 1860s. Blues has incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads from the African-American culture. The blues form is ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale, and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or ""worried notes""), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. Blues music is characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African Americans. Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the music of Africa. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the African-American community, the spirituals. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery, with the development of juke joints occurring later. It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. Blues subgenres include country blues, Delta blues and Piedmont blues, as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago blues and West Coast blues. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock developed, which blended blues styles with rock music.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues,Rhythm and blues,Blues music history,"Rhythm and blues, frequently abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated within African American communities in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when ""rocking, jazz based music ... [with a] heavy, insistent beat"" was starting to become more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations. The term ""rhythm and blues"" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term ""R&B"" became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. By the 1970s, the term ""rhythm and blues"" had changed once again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the late 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as ""contemporary R&B"". This contemporary form combines rhythm and blues with various elements of pop, soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic music. Although Jerry Wexler of Billboard magazine is credited with coining the term ""rhythm and blues"" as a musical term in the United States in 1948, the term had been used in Billboard as early as 1943. However, the company's first list of songs popular among African Americans was named Harlem Hit Parade; created in 1942, it listed the ""most popular records in Harlem,"" and is the predecessor to the Billboard RnB chart. ""Rhythm and Blues"" replaced the common term ""race music"", a term coined by Okeh producer Ralph Peer based on the common self description by the African American press as ""people of race."" The term ""rhythm and blues"" was then used by Billboard in its chart listings from June 1949 until August 1969, when its ""Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles"" chart was renamed as ""Best Selling Soul Singles"". Before the ""Rhythm and Blues"" name was instated, various record companies had already begun replacing the term ""race ",Rhythm and blues | African-American cultural history | African-American music | American styles of music | African-American society | 1940s,"1948, 1942, 1943, 1949, 1969","Etymology, definitions and description | History | Precursors | Late 1940s | Afro-Cuban rhythmic influence | Early to mid-1950s | Late 1950s | 1960s–1970s","Stylistic origins: Jazz[2]

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_rock,Blues rock,Blues music history,"Blues rock is a fusion genre and form of rock and blues music that relies on the chords/scales and instrumental improvisation of blues. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock (electric guitar, electric bass guitar, drums, and sometimes with keyboards and harmonica). From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal. Blues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric Chicago blues songs, such as those by Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, and Jimmy Reed, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who put several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents. Some of these bands also played long, involved improvisations as were then commonplace on jazz records. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the style became more hard rock-oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the early Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend, along with Led Zeppelin, Ten Years After, Chicken Shack, and Foghat in the UK. Along with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on album-oriented rock radio in the United States, and later the classic rock format established there during the 1980s. The blues gave rock a mother’s unconditional love, nurturing it through its difficult stages and always providing a welcome return no matter how far it strayed from home. Blues rock can be characterized by bluesy improvisation, extended boogie jams typically focused on electric guitar solos, and often a heavier, riff-oriented sound and feel to the songs than found in typical Chicago-style blues. Blues rock bands ""borrow[ed] the idea of an instrumental combo and loud amplification from rock & roll"". It is also often played at a fast tempo, again distinguishing it from the blues.",Blues rock | Blues music genres | Fusion music genres | British styles of music | American styles of music | 1960s in music | Rock music genres,,Characteristics | 1960s–1970s | 1980s–present | See also | References | Bibliography,"Stylistic origins: Electric bluesbluesrock | Cultural origins: Early to mid-1960s, United States and United Kingdom | Typical instruments: Electric guitarelectric bass guitardrumskeyboardsharmonica | Derivative forms: Boogie rockheavy metal[1][2]hard rockSouthern rock",2226,2025-06-22 19:33:16

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley,Bob Marley,Bob Marley,"Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, he fused elements of reggae, ska and rocksteady and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and became a global figure in popular culture. He became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. Marley is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms. Marley also supported the legalisation of cannabis and advocated for Pan-Africanism. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which became the Wailers. In 1965, they released their debut studio album, The Wailing Wailers, which included the single ""One Love"", a reworking of ""People Get Ready"". It was popular worldwide and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers released 11 more studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, changed their name to Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, they began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari. Around this time, Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971). Bob Marley and the Wailers began to gain international attention after signing to Island and touring in support of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973). Following their disbandment a year later, Marley carried on under the band's name. The album Natty Dread (1974) received positive reviews. In 1975, following the global popularity of Eric Clapton's version of Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"", Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, a live version of ""No Woman, No Cry"", from the Live! album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, Rastaman Vibration (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts. A few months later, Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which was believed to be politically motivated. He permanently relocated to London, where he recorded the album Exodus, which incorporated element",Bob Marley | 1945 births | 1981 deaths | 20th-century Eastern Orthodox Christians | 20th-century Jamaican male singers | 20th-century Jamaican people | Anti-apartheid activists | Beverley's Records artists,"1965, 1963, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1945, 1981, 1974, 1971",Early life | Career | 1962–1972: Early years | 1972–1974: Move to Island Records | 1974–1976: Line-up changes and Assault | 1976–1979: Relocation to England | 1979–1980: Later years | Personal life,"Born: Robert Nesta Marley(1945-02-06)6 February 1945Nine Mile, Saint Ann, Colony of Jamaica | Died: 11 May 1981(1981-05-11) (aged 36)Miami, Florida, US | Resting place: Bob Marley Mausoleum, Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica | Other names: Berhane Selassie

The album's production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the band, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sexuality. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of making love and keeping faith. On 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley's life in which his chest was grazed and his arm was struck with a bullet, but he survived. Following the assassination attempt, Marley left Jamaica and moved to London, where Exodus was recorded. The album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom. In 2017, Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. There are more tracks from Exodus on Marley’s greatest hits compilation Legend than from any of his other records. Exodus was his tenth album since the debut album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, including the live album Live! (1975). In 1974, two of the original Wailers, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, left the band. The band continued releasing material as ""Bob Marley & The Wailers,"" as had sometimes been the case in the Lee Perry era (as with the Soul Rebels and Soul Revolution LPs). His current backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston ""Family Man"" Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Al Anderson and Junior Marvin on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl ""Wya"" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin ""Seeco"" Patterson on percussion. The I Threes, consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife Rita Marley provided backing vocals. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, ""No Woman, No Cry"", from the Natty Dread album.

Washington,"Ernest Davidson Washington Booker Taliaferro Washington (April 5, 1856 – November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author, and orator. Between 1890 and 1915, Washington was the primary leader in the African-American community and of the contemporary Black elite. Born into slavery on April 5, 1856, in Hale's Ford, Virginia, Washington was freed when U.S. troops reached the area during the Civil War. As a young man, Booker T. Washington worked his way through Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute and attended college at Wayland Seminary. In 1881, he was named as the first leader of the new Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, an institute for black higher education. He expanded the college, enlisting students in construction of buildings. Work at the college was considered fundamental to students' larger education. He attained national prominence for his Atlanta Address of 1895, which attracted the attention of politicians and the public. Washington played a dominant role in black politics, winning wide support in the black community of the South and among more liberal whites. Washington wrote an autobiography, Up from Slavery, in 1901, which became a major text. In that year, he dined with Theodore Roosevelt at the White House, which was the first time a black person publicly met the president on equal terms. After an illness, he died in Tuskegee, Alabama on November 14, 1915. Washington was a key proponent of African-American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League. Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with the goal of building the community's economic strength and pride by focusing on self-help and education. Washington had the ear of the powerful in the United States of his day, including presidents. He used the nineteenth-century American political system to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, distribute funds, and reward a cadre of supporters. Because of his influential leadership, the timespan of his activity, from 1880 to 1915, has been called the Age of Booker T. Washington. Washington called for Black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of Black voters in the South. Furthermore, he supported racial uplift, but secretly also supported court challenges to segregation and to restrictions on voter reg",Booker T.

Booker T. Washington HSPVA enrolls students in grades 9-12 and is the Dallas Independent School District's arts magnet school (thus, it is often locally referred to simply as Arts Magnet). Many accomplished performers and artists have been educated in the school, including Norah Jones, Erykah Badu, Adario Strange, Valarie Rae Miller, Edie Brickell, Kennedy Davenport, Sandra St. Victor, Roy Hargrove, Scott Westerfeld, and Cecil Eugene Moore Jr. Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Banks is among the most notable graduates of the school previous to its conversion to the Arts Magnet. In 1892, Dallas established its first high school for African-American pupils. In 1911, the school was enlarged and named the Dallas Colored High School. The school was moved in 1922 to larger quarters, designed by famed Dallas architects Lang and Witchell, and renamed Booker T. Washington High School, after the African-American education pioneer Booker T. Washington. For many years, it was the only Dallas high school that allowed students of color. In 1939, Wilmer-Hutchins Colored High School of the Wilmer-Hutchins ISD burned down in a fire. Afterwards, African-American WHISD students were sent to DISD high schools for ""colored"" people such as Washington. In 1942, teacher Thelma Paige Richardson sued the Dallas School District, demanding equalization of pay based upon tenure and merit; the school district denied that any discrimination was taking place.

Jones was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on November 12, 1944. He was named after his father, Booker T. Jones Sr., who was named in honor of Booker T. Washington, the educator. Booker T. Jones Sr. was a science teacher at Memphis High School, providing the family with a relatively stable, lower middle-class lifestyle. Jones was musically a child prodigy, playing the oboe, saxophone, trombone, double bass, and piano at school and organ at church. Jones attended Booker T. Washington High School, the alma mater of Rufus Thomas, and collaborated with future stars like Isaac Hayes's writing partner David Porter, saxophonist Andrew Love of the Memphis Horns, soul singer/songwriter William Bell, and Earth, Wind & Fire's singer/songwriter Maurice White. [citation needed] Jones's entry into professional music came at the age of 16, when he played baritone saxophone on Satellite (soon to be Stax) Records' first hit, ""Cause I Love You"", by Carla and Rufus Thomas. Willie Mitchell hired Jones for his band, in which Jones started on sax and later moved to bass. It was here that he met Al Jackson Jr., whom he brought to Stax. Simultaneously, Jones formed a combo with Maurice White and David Porter, in which he played guitar.","1944 births | Living people | Songwriters from Tennessee | American male composers | 20th-century American composers | American session musicians | Booker T. & the M.G.'s members | Musicians from Memphis, Tennessee",1944,Biography | Solo discography | Collaborations | Current lineup | Notes | References | External links,"Birth name: Booker Taliaferro Jones Jr. | Also known as: Booker T. | Born: (1944-11-12) November 12, 1944 (age 80)Memphis, Tennessee, U.S. | Genres: R&Binstrumental rocksoulelectric blues | Occupations: Musiciansongwriterrecord producerarranger",1567,2025-06-22 19:38:47
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_music,Calypso music,Calypso music Caribbean,"Music television Calypso is a style of Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago from Afro-Trinidadians during the early- to mid-19th century and spread to the rest of the Caribbean Antilles by the mid-20th century. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 18th century. It is characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and was historically most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a chantuelle and eventually, calypsonian. As English replaced ""patois"" (Antillean) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the actions of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression. Calypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including benna in Antigua and Barbuda; mento, a style of Jamaican folk music that greatly influenced ska, the precursor to rocksteady, and reggae; spouge, a style of Barbadian popular music; Dominica cadence-lypso, which mixed calypso with the cadence of Haiti; and soca music, a style of kaiso/calypso, with influences from chutney, soul, funk, Latin and cadence-lypso. It is thought that the name ""calypso"" was originally ""kaiso"" which is now believed to come from Efik ""ka isu"" (""go on!"") and Ibibio ""kaa iso"" (""continue, go on""), used in urging someone on or in backing a contestant. There is also a Trinidadian term ""cariso"" that means ""old-time"" calypsos. The term ""calypso"" is recorded from the 1930s onwards. Alternatively, the insert for The Rough Guide to Calypso and Soca (published by World Music Network) favours John Cowley's arguments in Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making, that the word might be a corruption of the French carrouseaux and through the process of patois and Anglicization became caliso and then finally ""calypso""; however, Cowley also notes that the first mention of the word ""calypso"" is given in a description of a dance in 1882 by Abbé Masse.",Calypso music | Kaiso | Culture of the Caribbean | Trinidad and Tobago styles of music | Music of the African diaspora,1882,Etymology | History of Calypso | Musical Features | Rhythms | Lyrics | Ancestral Religiosity | Instrumentation | Recordings,"Stylistic origins: KaisoCanboulay | Cultural origins: Early 19th century, Trinidad and Tobago | Typical instruments: TrumpetTromboneSaxophoneGuitarDouble bassCongasMaracaPiano | Derivative forms: Soca",2266,2025-06-22 19:34:52

They are each synthesis of African, European, Asian and Indigenous influences, largely created by descendants of African enslaved people (see Afro-Caribbean music), along with contributions from other communities (such as Indo-Caribbean music). Some of the styles to gain wide popularity outside the Caribbean include, bachata, merengue, palo, mambo, baithak gana, bouyon, cadence-lypso, calypso, soca, chutney, chutney-soca, compas, dancehall, jing ping, parang, pichakaree, punta, ragga, reggae, dembow, reggaeton, salsa, and zouk. Caribbean music is also related to Central American and South American music. The history of Caribbean music originates from the history of the Caribbean itself. That history is one of the native land invaded by outsiders; violence, slavery, and even genocide factor in. Following Christopher Columbus' landing in 1492, Spain laid claim to the entire Caribbean. This claim was met with dissatisfaction from both the natives and Spain's neighbors in Europe; within a few years, bloody battles between the European powers raged across the region. These battles, alongside the various European diseases which accompanied them, decimated the native tribes who inhabited the islands. Thus the Caribbean was colonized as part of the various European empires. Native cultures were further eroded when the Europeans imported African slaves to work the sugar and coffee plantations on their island colonies. In many cases, native cultures (and native musics) were replaced by those imported from Africa and Europe.",Caribbean music | Music of Latin America | Lists of music genres,1492,Antigua and Barbuda | Benna | Bahamas | Barbados | Belize | Colombia | Cuba | Dominica,,1580,2025-06-22 19:34:53
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soca_music,Soca music,Calypso music Caribbean,"Music television Soca music, or the ""soul of calypso"", is a genre of music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s. It is considered an offshoot of calypso, with influences from Afro-Trinidadian and Indo-Trinidadian rhythms. It was created by Ras Shorty I (or Lord Shorty) in an effort to revive traditional calypso, the popularity of which had been declining amongst younger generations in Trinidad due to the rise in popularity of reggae from Jamaica and soul and funk from the United States. From the 1980s onward, soca has developed into a range of new styles. ""Soca"" is a portmanteau of the words ""soul"" and ""calypso"". The genre was defined by Lord Shorty as the ""Soul of Calypso."" The word was originally spelled s-o-k-a-h by Lord Shorty. In a 1979 interview with Carnival Magazine, Lord Shorty stated that he ""came up with the name soca. I invented soca. And I never spelt it s-o-c-a. It was s-o-k-a-h to reflect the East Indian influence."" The use of kah (the Hindi word for ‘divine’) referenced the genre's Indo-Caribbean influence. However, s-o-c-a quickly became the popular spelling after a journalist, Ivor Ferreira, misspelled the name. The article, which included an interview with Lord Shorty, was published during the 1976 Trinidad Carnival season. The article said ""Shorty is doing soca"". Lord Shorty confirmed the error, but chose to leave it that way to avoid confusion.[citation needed]",Soca music | Calypso music | Kaiso | Trinidad and Tobago styles of music,"1979, 1976",Etymology | History | Lord Shorty | French Creole impact on soca | Related genres | Afrosoca | Chutney soca | Ragga soca,"Stylistic origins: Cadence

She started writing songs at the age of 13; over the years, she has composed more than 1000 songs and recorded more than 20 albums. Considered the ""mother of calypso"", Rose was the first female calypso star and her lyrics frequently address social issues like racism and sexism. Her influence over the calypso music genre forced the renaming of the Calypso King competition to the Calypso Monarch instead. In addition to writing songs about social issues, Rose is also an activist and was given the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for former child soldiers along with performing at numerous events for social change. She has received every award available to living artists in the Caribbean. She currently resides in Queens, New York, and regularly returns to Trinidad and Tobago in addition to touring. Calypso Rose was born with the name Linda McCartha Monica Sandy-Lewis. Her mother gave her this name as an homage a respectable army general by the name of Douglas MacArthur. At the beginning of her music career, the singer originally took the name Crusoe Kid but later changed it to Calypso Rose. This occurred when she auditioned for the managers of a calypso tent called Young Brigade. The name Crusoe Kid was meant to signify her origins in Tobago, and a reference to the novel Robinson Crusoe. After hearing her perform, the managers at Young Brigade renamed her Calypso Rose because a rose is considered the mother of all flowers and she considers herself the mother of female calypsonians that came after her. She grew up in the small village of Bethel on the island of Tobago, one of the two Caribbean islands forming Trinidad and Tobago and the birthplace of calypso. Rose's earliest memory is her grandmother sitting at the seashore and telling her that no one knows where they would be buried because her grandmother was originally from French Guinea and ended up in Tobago because she was kidnapped and sold there. Calypso Rose was the fourth child to be born by her mother, Dorchea Sandy, who had a total of thirteen children, two of which passed away. Her father, Altino Sandy, was a leader of the Spiritual Shouter Baptists. In addition to being a leader in the church, he was also a fisherman and Rose would to go with him every evening to the beach when she lived with him.

Antigua and Barbuda is a Caribbean nation in the Lesser Antilles island chain. The country is a second home for many of the pan-Caribbean genres of popular music, and has produced stars in calypso, soca, steeldrum, zouk and reggae. Of these, steeldrum and calypso are the most integral parts of modern Antiguan popular music; both styles are imported from the music of Trinidad and Tobago. Little to no musical research has been undertaken on Antigua and Barbuda other than this. As a result, much knowledge on the topic derives from novels, essays and other secondary sources. Documented music in Antigua and Barbuda began only with the discovery of Antigua, then populated by Arawak and Caribs, by Christopher Columbus in 1493. The islands' early music, however, remains little studied. In the 1780s, documentation exists for African workers participating in outdoor dances accompanied by the banjar (later bangoe, perhaps related to the banjo) and toombah (later tum tum), a drum decorated with shell and tin jingles.

It is a highly anticipated festival in the Caribbean where locals and visitors come together to dance, savor cultural music, and indulge in delicious foods. It stems from a pagan holiday, later adopted by the Roman Catholic Church as Carne Vale. European slave traders brought it to the Caribbean, excluding African slaves and hosting lavish masquerade balls. After emancipation, freed African slaves transformed the festival into a celebration of freedom, blending African heritage and Caribbean Creole culture. In 1834, the Caribbean festival took root in Trinidad and Tobago, when French settlers brought the Fat Tuesday masquerade tradition to the island. It soon became a vibrant celebration, blending Creole Canboulay festivities with the European masquerade, eventually evolving into the modern Caribbean Carnival. At its start, formerly enslaved individuals expressed their freedom through music, clothing, and dance, leading to the dynamic fusion of African influences and Creole culture. Carnival traditions differ across islands, typically consisting of activities like playing Mas (masquerade), the selection of a King and Queen, and reveling in diverse Caribbean music styles like calypso, jam-band, steelpan, and soca. Pre-carnival festivities such as J'ouvert feature cultural characters such as the Moko Jumbie and Dame Lorraine, adding to the vibrant celebrations. Although there are similar celebrations, not every Caribbean Carnival adopts the name ""carnival"". For instance, Junkanoo (also Jonkunnu) which originated in Jamaica, is a traditional Christmastime festival with similar characters and blend of cultures. It is also celebrated in the Bahamas, Belize and North Carolina.

In the Caribbean, England colonised the islands of St. Kitts and Barbados in 1623 and 1627 respectively, and later, Jamaica in 1655. In these islands and England's other Caribbean colonies, white colonists would gradually introduce a system of slave-based labor to underpin a new economy based on cash crop production. In the mid-16th century, slaves were trafficked from Africa to the Caribbean by Europeans. Originally, white European indentured servants worked alongside enslaved Africans in the Americas. François Bernier, who is considered to have presented the first modern concept of race, published his work “A New Division of the Earth according to the Different Species or Races of Men Who Inhabit It” in 1684, over 100 years after slaves were brought to the ""New World"" (the Americas).",Slavery in the French West Indies | Slavery in the British West Indies | History of the Caribbean | Agriculture in the Caribbean | History of sugar | British colonization of the Americas | French colonization of the Americas,"1655, 1627, 1623, 1684",History | French Institution of Slavery | Slave trade | General overview | Anglo-American institution of slavery | Abolition | See also | References,,942,2025-06-22 19:34:21
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Caribbean,History of the Caribbean,Caribbean slavery history,"The history of the Caribbean reveals the region's significant role in the colonial struggles of the European powers since the 15th century. In the modern era, it remains strategically and economically important. In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Caribbean and claimed the region for Spain. The following year, the first Spanish settlements were established in the Caribbean. Although the Spanish conquests of the Aztec empire and the Inca empire in the early sixteenth century made Mexico and Peru more desirable places for Spanish exploration and settlement, the Caribbean remained strategically important. From the 1620s and 1630s onwards, non-Hispanic privateers, traders, and settlers established permanent colonies and trading posts on the Caribbean islands neglected by Spain. Such colonies spread throughout the Caribbean, from the Bahamas in the northwest to Tobago in the southeast. Furthermore, during this period, French, Dutch, and English buccaneers settled on the island of Tortuga, the northern and western coasts of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), and later in Jamaica as well as the island of Martinica. After the Spanish–American War in 1898, the islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico were no longer part of the Spanish Empire in the New World. In the 20th century, the Caribbean was again important during World War II, in the decolonization wave after the war, and in the tension between Communist Cuba and the United States. The exploitation of the labor of Indigenous peoples and the demographic collapse of that population, forced migration of enslaved Africans, immigration of Europeans, Chinese, South Asians, and others, and rivalry amongst world powers since the sixteenth century have given Caribbean history an impact disproportionate to its size. Many islands have attained independence from colonial powers and sovereignty; others have formal political ties with major powers, including the United States. The early economic structure integrating the Caribbean into the Atlantic world and world economic system continues to impact the modern Caribbean region. During European contact in 1492, Caribbean islands were densely populated by different indigenous groups. Recent scholarly research has investigated the origins and evolution of the islands' populations over the entire period.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery,History of slavery,Caribbean slavery history,"The history of slavery spans many cultures, nationalities, and religions from ancient times to the present day. Likewise, its victims have come from many different ethnicities and religious groups. The social, economic, and legal positions of slaves have differed vastly in different systems of slavery in different times and places. Slavery has been found in some hunter-gatherer populations, particularly as hereditary slavery, but the conditions of agriculture with increasing social and economic complexity offer greater opportunity for mass chattel slavery. Slavery was institutionalized by the time the first civilizations emerged (such as Sumer in Mesopotamia, which dates back as far as 3500 BC). Slavery features in the Mesopotamian Code of Hammurabi (c. 1750 BC), which refers to it as an established institution. Slavery was widespread in the ancient world in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. and the Americas. Slavery became less common throughout Europe during the Early Middle Ages but continued to be practiced in some areas. Both Christians and Muslims captured and enslaved each other during centuries of warfare in the Mediterranean and Europe. Islamic slavery encompassed mainly Western and Central Asia, Northern and Eastern Africa, India, and Europe from the 7th to the 20th century. Islamic law approved of enslavement of non-Muslims, and slaves were trafficked from non-Muslim lands: from the North via the Balkan slave trade and the Crimean slave trade; from the East via the Bukhara slave trade; from the West via Andalusian slave trade; and from the South via the Trans-Saharan slave trade, the Red Sea slave trade and the Indian Ocean slave trade. Beginning in the 16th century, European merchants, starting mainly with merchants from Portugal, initiated the transatlantic slave trade. Few traders ventured far inland, attempting to avoid tropical diseases and violence. They mostly purchased imprisoned Africans (and exported commodities including gold and ivory) from West African kingdoms, transporting them to Europe's colonies in the Americas. The merchants were sources of desired goods including guns, gunpowder, copper manillas, and cloth, and this demand for imported goods drove local wars and other means to the enslavement of Africans in ever greater numbers. In India and throughout the New World, people were forced into slavery to create the local workforce.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_New_Jersey,History of slavery in New Jersey,Caribbean slavery history,"Slavery in New Jersey began in the early 17th century, when the Dutch trafficked African slaves for labor to develop the colony of New Netherland.: 44 After the English took control of the colony in 1664, they continued the importation of slaves from Africa. They also imported ""seasoned"" slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas. Most Dutch and English settlers entered the colony as indentured servants, who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage. As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined, slave-trading companies imported more Africans for needed labor. To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony, the colonial government awarded settlers headrights of 60 acres (24 ha) of land for each person transported to the colony. In 1704, after East Jersey and West Jersey were unified, the royal colony of the province passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free Blacks from owning property, further restricting Africans and African-Americans.: 44 During the American Revolution, enslaved people fought on both sides. The Patriots banned the importation of new slaves, as they were largely transported to the region on British slave ships, and the New Jersey Legislature later freed any slave imported after 1776. The British promised freedom to slaves who would leave Patriot masters and fight for them. The number of Blacks in Manhattan increased to 10,000, as thousands of enslaved Africans escaped to the British for the promise of freedom. Bergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state, in part because many enslaved Africans were used as laborers in its ports and cities. At its peak Bergen County enslaved 3,000 Africans in 1800, constituting nearly 20% of its total population. After the Revolutionary War, many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery, but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804, and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York. However, in New Jersey, some Blacks were still held in bondage as late as 1865. (In New York, they were all freed by 1827.) The law declared that children born to enslaved mothers after July 4, 1804, would be free at birth, but it required those children to serve lengthy apprenticeships as a type of indentured servant until early adulthood for the masters of their mothers kept in bondage.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Florida,History of slavery in Florida,Caribbean slavery history,"Slavery in Florida occurred among indigenous tribes and during Spanish rule. Florida's purchase by the United States from Spain in 1819 (effective 1821) was primarily a measure to strengthen the system of slavery on Southern plantations, by denying potential runaways the formerly safe haven of Florida. Florida became a slave state, seceded, and passed laws to exile or enslave free blacks. Even after abolition, forced labor continued. Few enslaved Africans were imported into Florida from Cuba in the period of Spanish colonial rule, as there was little for them to do—no mines, no plantations. Starting in 1687, slaves escaping from English colonies to the north were freed when they reached Florida and accepted Catholic baptism. Black slavery in the region was widely established after Florida came under British then American control. Slavery in Florida was theoretically abolished by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln, though as the state was then part of the Confederacy this had little immediate effect. Slavery in Florida did not end abruptly on one specific day. As news arrived of the end of the Civil War and the collapse of the Confederacy in the spring of 1865, slavery unofficially ended, as there were no more slave catchers or other authority to enforce the peculiar institution. Newly emancipated African Americans departed their plantations, often in search of relatives who were separated from their family. The end of slavery was made formal by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865. Some of the characteristics of slavery, such as inability to leave an abusive situation, continued under sharecropping, convict leasing, and vagrancy laws. In the 20th and 21st centuries, conditions approximating slavery are found among marginal immigrant populations, especially migrant farm workers and trafficked sex workers. The Florida Slavery Memorial is planned. Enslavement predates the period of European colonization and was practiced by various indigenous peoples.

Achebe was first regarded as the ""father of modern African literature"" by Nadine Gordimer, although he rejected the title throughout his career. Achebe published five novels: Things Fall Apart, No Longer at Ease, Arrow of God, A Man of the People, and Anthills of the Savannah,[a] and four children's books: Chike and the River, How the Leopard Got His Claws, The Flute, and The Drum; and two short story collections: The Sacrificial Egg and Girls at War; four essay collections: Morning Yet on Creation Day, Hopes and Impediments, Home and Exile, and The Education of a British-Protected Child; a book of political criticism, The Trouble with Nigeria, and a memoir, There Was a Country. Achebe's Another Africa contains one essay and poems, and also photographs by Robert Lyons. American literary critic Elaine Showalter considers Things Fall Apart and Anthills of the Savannah as Achebe's best books. Achebe's works have been extensively studied by academics and scholars, and won him several awards. His legacy is celebrated annually during the Chinua Achebe Literary Festival.

His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958) occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated, and read African novel. Along with Things Fall Apart, his No Longer at Ease (1960) and Arrow of God (1964) complete the ""African Trilogy"". Later novels include A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). Achebe is often referred to as the ""father of modern African literature"", although he vigorously rejected the characterization. Born in Ogidi, Colonial Nigeria, Achebe's childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and colonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how Western literature depicted Africa. Moving to Lagos after graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel Things Fall Apart. In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher Heinemann, with whom he began the Heinemann African Writers Series and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and Flora Nwapa. Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness"", which was a landmark in postcolonial discourse. Published in The Massachusetts Review, it featured criticism of Albert Schweitzer and Joseph Conrad, whom Achebe described as ""a thoroughgoing racist"". When the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe supported Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the movement. The subsequent Nigerian Civil War ravaged the populace, and he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon became disillusioned by his frustration over the contin",1930 births | 2013 deaths | Chinua Achebe | 20th-century Nigerian essayists | 20th-century Nigerian male writers | 20th-century Nigerian novelists | 20th-century Nigerian poets | 20th-century short story writers,"1958, 1987, 1975, 1967, 1960, 1966, 1964, 1930, 2013",Life and career | Youth and background (1930–1947) | University (1948–1953) | Teaching and producing (1953–1956) | Things Fall Apart (1957–1960) | No Longer at Ease and fellowship travels (1960–1961) | Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series (1961–1964) | Arrow of God (1964–1966),"Born: Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe(1930-11-16)16 November 1930Ogidi, Colonial Nigeria | Died: 21 March 2013(2013-03-21) (aged 82)Boston, Massachusetts, US | Notable works: ""The African Trilogy"":  Things Fall Apart (1958) No Longer at Ease (1960) Arrow of God (1964)

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart,Things Fall Apart,Chinua Achebe writer,"Things Fall Apart is a 1958 novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. It is Achebe's debut novel and was written when he was working at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. The novel was first published in London by Heinemann on 17 June 1958. The story, which is set in British Nigeria, centers on Okonkwo, a traditional influential leader of the fictional Igbo clan, Umuofia, who opposes colonialism and early Christianity. The novel's title was taken from a verse of ""The Second Coming"", a 1919 poem by Irish poet W. B. Yeats. Things Fall Apart formed the first part of his ""African trilogy"" with his novels No Longer at Ease and Arrow of God. The novel explores many themes, especially culture, masculinity, and colonialism. Things Fall Apart is regarded as a milestone in African literature. It gained critical acclaim and popularity upon publication, and has been translated into over fifty languages. It was listed on Time's ""100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005"". The novel has had several adaptations, including the radio drama, Okonkwo (1961), by the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation; 1971 film, Things Fall Apart, which starred Princess Elizabeth of Toro. Okonkwo is a famous man in the village of Umuofia. He is a wrestling champion and leader of a clan. He strives to be the opposite of his father Unoka, who was an indolent debtor unable to support his wife or children, preferring flute-playing over struggling for success. Okonkwo works hard from a young age to build fame and wealth all on his own.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_civil_rights_movement,Northern Ireland civil rights movement,Civil Rights Movement 1960s,"The Northern Ireland civil rights movement dates to the early 1960s, when a number of initiatives emerged in Northern Ireland which challenged the inequality and discrimination against ethnic Irish Catholics that was perpetrated by the Ulster Protestant establishment (composed largely of Protestant Ulster loyalists and unionists). The Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was founded by Conn McCluskey and his wife, Patricia. Conn was a doctor, and Patricia was a social worker who had worked in Glasgow for a period, and who had a background in housing activism. Both were involved in the Homeless Citizens League, an organisation founded after Catholic women occupied disused social housing. The HCL evolved into the CSJ, focusing on lobbying, research and publicising discrimination. The campaign for Derry University was another mid-1960s campaign. The most important organisation established during this period was the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), established in 1967 to protest discrimination. NICRA's objectives were: The Parliament of Northern Ireland did not follow Westminster in changes to the franchise from 1945 - One man, one vote. As a result, into the late 1960s, plural voting was still allowed not only for local government (as it was for local government in Great Britain), but also for the Parliament of Northern Ireland. This meant that in local council elections (as in Great Britain), ratepayers and their spouses, whether renting or owning the property, could vote. Company directors had an extra vote by virtue of their company's status. However, unlike the situation in Great Britain, non-ratepayers did not have a vote in local government elections. The property franchise (which granted votes in local elections only to those who owned property) weighted representation heavily in favour of the Protestant community, as did the plural business votes they enjoyed for parliamentary elections. The result was that many towns and cities with a Catholic majority, even a substantial one, were Unionist-controlled: examples included Derry, Armagh, Dungannon, and Enniskillen.",1967 in Northern Ireland | 1967 protests | 1968 in Northern Ireland | 1968 protests | 1969 in Northern Ireland | 1969 protests | 1970 in Northern Ireland | 1971 in Northern Ireland,"1967, 1945","Background | Derry, 5 October 1968 | People's Democracy | Battle of the Bogside | References",Date: 1967 – 1972 | Location: Northern Ireland | Goals: Civil and political rights,2119,2025-06-22 19:39:31

In some situations, they have been accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and armed rebellion. The process has been long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not, or have yet to, fully achieve their goals, although the efforts of these movements have led to improvements in the legal rights of some previously oppressed groups of people, in some places.

These include but are not limited to the rights of minorities, women's rights, disability rights and LGBT rights.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toasting_(Jamaican_music),Toasting (Jamaican music),Dancehall music Jamaica,"Toasting (rap in other parts of the Anglo Caribbean) or deejaying is the act of talking, usually in a monotone melody, over a rhythm or beat by a deejay. It can either be improvised or pre-written. Toasting developed in Jamaica, before it took up that name and being part of the sound system era, a similar sound of it is found in mento and now can be heard over musical styles including ska, reggae, dancehall, dub, grime, hip hop, soca and bouyon music. The combination of singing and toasting is known as singjaying. In the late 1950s in Jamaica, one of the first Selector, also being a promoter optimized of using a mic and to entertain an audience while playing records was Count Matchuki. He conceived the idea for being comically entertaining from listening to commercial ads and disc jockeys on American radio stations etc. He would create and come up with comical phrases also doing African American jive over the music while selecting and playing R&B music. Deejays like Count Machuki working for producers would play the latest hits on traveling sound systems at parties and add his vocals to the music. These talks consisted of comedy, boastful commentaries, half-sung rhymes, rhythmic chants, squeals, screams and rhymed storytelling. Osbourne Ruddock (a.k.a. King Tubby) was a Jamaican sound recording engineer who created vocal-less rhythm backing tracks that were used by DJs doing toasting by creating one-off vinyl discs (also known as dub plates) of songs without the vocals and adding echo and sound effects. Late 1960s toasting deejays included U-Roy and Dennis Alcapone, the latter known for mixing gangster talk with humor in his toasting. In the early 1970s, toasting deejays included I-Roy (his nickname is in homage to U-Roy) and Dillinger, the latter known for his humorous toasting style. In the early 1970s with the rise of dub Big Youth became popular, also Prince Jazzbo in his early appearance toasting with more cadence on dubs. In the late 1970s, Trinity followed. The 1980s saw the first deejay toasting duo, Michigan & Smiley, and the development of toasting outside of Jamaica. In England, Pato Banton explored his Caribbean roots, humorous and political toasting while Ranking Roger of the Second Wave or Two-Tone ska revival band The Beat from the 1980s did Jamaican toasting over music that blended ska, pop, and some punk influences.",Poetic rhythm | Reggae | Music of Jamaica | Dancehall,,See also | References,,2374,2025-06-22 19:34:57
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall_pop,Dancehall pop,Dancehall music Jamaica,"Dancehall pop is a sub-genre of the Jamaican genre dancehall that originated in the early 2000s. Developing from the sounds of reggae, dancehall pop is characteristically different in its fusion with western pop music and digital music production. Dancehall pop is also different from dancehall in that most songs use lesser Jamaican Patois in lyrics––allowing it to be globally understood and consumed. It also incorporates the key pop music elements of having melodies, hooks, and the verse-chorus format. Additionally, the genre moves away from the reggae and roots reggae music origins in social and political protest, now lyrically centering on partying, dancing, and sexuality. By the early 2000s, dancehall pop had its entrance into the global music industry. As the sub-genre of its fathering music style dancehall, dancehall pop combines instrumental reggae and drum patterns of Jamaican sounds with the vocal melodies and catchy lyrics of pop music. The name of the genre itself is also credited to Jamaican music lifestyle, where artists and producers would play music from sound systems in local dancehalls. The socio-political changes after the 1970s government change in Jamaica affected dancehall styles, where lyrics moved away from political protest and more towards partying lifestyle. The dancehall genre trend of reusing beats, also known as “reworking”, is also still evident in dancehall pop as well, with many artists sampling old school dancehall track instrumentals––colloquially known as ""riddims"". While dancehall music has its cultural origins in Jamaican sound and music, the dancehall pop genre combines rhythm and sounds from across in the Caribbean including that of soca, calypso and reggaeton. The fusion between dancehall and pop is attributed to the early digitisation of musical production in Jamaica, where the format of pop music––such as the melodic verse-chorus structure and repeated choruses––could be combined with the fast-paced instrumental rhythms of dancehall. Dancehall pop music did not make its mainstream arrival into the music industry until the early 2000s. Dancehall and soca songs such as Kevin Lyttle's ""Turn Me On"" and Rupee's ""Tempted to Touch"", both released in 2002 and 2003 respectively, are examples of the early combinations of the digital pop style and Caribbean rhythms into the western music scene.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vybz_Kartel,Vybz Kartel,Dancehall music Jamaica,"Adidja Azim Palmer (born 7 January 1976), better known as Vybz Kartel, is a Jamaican dancehall artist. Among his various nicknames, he is referred to as Worl' Boss, Teacha and King of Dancehall. As summarized by Rolling Stone, he ""attained folk-hero status in Jamaica with provocative lyrics, and a mischievous public persona"", and ""few have captivated [the dancehall] audience – or offended the sensibilities of its detractors – as consistently and thoroughly as Kartel."" He has also been credited as an inspiration for the dancehall-infused work of a number of Western artists, including Drake, who has cited Kartel as being one of his ""biggest inspirations"". Kartel's singles include ""Romping Shop"" (2009), ""Dancehall Hero"" (2010), and ""Summer Time"" (2011). He has collaborated with a number of hip hop and R&B artists such as Major Lazer, Rihanna, Missy Elliott, and Alison Hinds. In 2014, Kartel was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his associate Clive ""Lizard"" Williams. Kartel often released new music despite his imprisonment, having released over 50 new songs in 2016 alone. His conviction was quashed in March 2024 by the UK Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who cited juror misconduct and declared that the Jamaican Court of Appeal had to decide if a retrial would take place. On 31 July 2024, Kartel was released from prison after the Court of Appeal declined to retry the Williams case. Palmer started his career as a teenager in 1993 with his first recording ""Love Fat Woman"", which he released on Alvin Reid's label ""One Heart"" using the moniker ""Adi Banton"", an homage to Buju Banton. Palmer was later part of the three-member group ""Vybz Kartel"", keeping the name for himself after the group split up. While still a member of the group, he claims to have written nearly 30 songs, including ""Gal Clown"". He eventually became a protege of Bounty Killer.","1976 births | Living people | Jamaican dancehall musicians | Jamaican people convicted of murder | Jamaican prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment | Jamaican reggae singers | Murder convictions without a body | Musicians from Kingston, Jamaica","2010, 1976, 2011, 2009, 1993, 2014, 2016, 2024",Life and career | 1993–2008: Rise to prominence | 2009–2013: Crossover and imprisonment | 2014–2024: Music and release | Personal life | Reception | Awards | Nominations,"Birth name: Adidja Azim Palmer | Also known as: AddiWorl' BossTeacha | Born: (1976-01-07) 7 January 1976 (age 49)[1]Kingston, Jamaica | Genres: Dancehallreggae | Occupations: Deejaysingersongwriterentrepreneurbusinessman",1891,2025-06-22 19:35:00
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes,The Supremes,Diana Ross Supremes,"The Supremes were an American girl group formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959 as the Primettes. A premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and the most successful American vocal band, with 12 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. Their breakthrough is considered to have made it possible for future African-American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. Billboard ranked the Supremes as the 16th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time. Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, the original members, were all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit. Forming as the Primettes, they were the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the group in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson continued as a trio. During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and Holland–Dozier–Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. In 1970, Ross left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Jean Terrell, and the group's name was reverted to the Supremes. During the mid-1970s, the lineup continued to change with Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene joining until the group, 18 years after its formation, disbanded in 1977. In Detroit in 1958, Florence Ballard, a junior high school student living in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, met Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who were two members of a Detroit singing group known as the Primes. Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams' girlfriend Betty McGlown, so Milton Jenkins, the Primes's manager, decided to create a sister group to be called the Primettes. Ballard recruited her best friend Mary Wilson, and then Paul Williams recruited Diana Ross. Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs of artists such as Ray Charles and the Drifters at sock hops, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area.

The Supremes are the most successful American group of all time, and the 26th greatest artist of all time on the US Billboard charts; with 12 number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (the fifth-best total in the chart's history) and three number-one albums on the Billboard 200. The Supremes were the first artist to accumulate five consecutive number-one singles on the US Hot 100 and the first female group to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with The Supremes A' Go-Go (1966). In 2017, Billboard ranked The Supremes as the number-one girl group of all time, publishing, 'although there have been many girl group smashes in the decades since the Supremes ruled the Billboard charts, no collective has yet to challenge their, for lack of a better word, supremacy.' In 2019, the UK Official Charts Company placed 7 Supremes songs—""You Can't Hurry Love"" (16), ""Baby Love"" (23), ""Stop! In the Name of Love"" (56), ""Where Did Our Love Go?"" (59), ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"" (78), ""Come See About Me"" (94) and ""Stoned Love"" (99)—on The Official Top 100 Motown songs of the Millennium chart, which ranks Motown releases by their all-time UK downloads and streams. In 2020, Insider.com named The Supremes ""the best-selling vocal group to date"", after Ebony estimated The Supremes' record sales at 50 million in 1980 and Euronews reported total sales exceeding 100 million records in 2014. This would make the group one of the best-selling music artists of all time. However, Motown refused to submit their books for industry audit, until the 1980s, years after the group disbanded.

The album was recorded over the course of the group's final engagement together at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, including the final night on January 14, 1970. The show marked Diana Ross' penultimate performance with fellow Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong. At the conclusion of the show, new Supremes lead singer Jean Terrell was brought onstage and introduced to the audience. The material performed in the show was a mix of popular Supremes hits, cover songs, and Broadway showtunes. During the extended twenty-minute rendition of ""Let The Sunshine In"", Diana Ross walked through the audience and let some of the guests sing the title-chorus of the song; some of these guests included Smokey Robinson and his wife Claudette, Dick Clark, Lou Rawls, Steve Allen, Bill Russell, Tina Turner, and Marvin Gaye. The live album was issued as a two-LP deluxe edition box set, produced by Deke Richards. The album was reissued as a gatefold two-LP set under the title Captured Live on Stage! in 1982, and as a two-disc compact disc reissue Captured Live on Stage!, in 1992. According to Mary Wilson, Berry Gordy had last-minute reservations about having Terrell replace Ross, as she was more independent and headstrong than Ross had been. Gordy called Wilson during the early morning hours following the final show, and informed her that he was going to instead replace Ross with his original choice for a Ross replacement, Syreeta Wright.",Albums produced by Deke Richards | 1970 live albums | The Supremes live albums | Motown live albums | 1970 collaborative albums | Live albums recorded in the Las Vegas Valley,"1992, 1970, 1982",History | Track listing | LP/disc one | LP/disc two | Personnel | Charts | References,"Released: April 13, 1970 | Recorded: New Frontier Hotel and Casino, January 14, 1970, 11:54 p.m. – 1:00 a.m. | Genre: Pop, soul | Length: 77:40 | Label: MotownMS2-708",1533,2025-06-22 19:38:04

She went on to release 26 studio albums, including Touch Me in the Morning (1973), Diana Ross (1976), Diana (1980), Why Do Fools Fall in Love (1981) and Swept Away (1984). Her singles ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", ""Touch Me in the Morning"", ""Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)"", ""Love Hangover"", ""Upside Down"" and ""Endless Love"", all topped the Billboard Hot 100, making her the female solo act with the most number-one songs in the United States at the time.

Ross has also achieved mainstream success and recognition as an actress. Her first role was her Golden Globe Award-winning and Academy Award-nominated portrayal of Billie Holiday in the film Lady Sings the Blues (1972), which made her the first African-American actress to receive an Academy Award nomination for a debut film performance. The film's soundtrack became her only solo album to reach number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. She also starred in two other feature films, Mahogany (1975) and The Wiz (1978), and later appeared in the television films Out of Darkness (1994), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and Double Platinum (1999).

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake,Nick Drake,Drake musician,"Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician. An accomplished acoustic guitarist, Drake signed to Island Records at the age of twenty while still a student at the University of Cambridge. His debut album, Five Leaves Left, was released in 1969, and was followed by two more albums, Bryter Layter (1971) and Pink Moon (1972). While Drake did not reach a wide audience during his brief lifetime, his music found critical acclaim and he gradually received wider recognition following his death. Drake suffered from depression and was reluctant to perform in front of live audiences. Upon completion of Pink Moon, he withdrew from both performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, Drake was found dead at the age of 26 due to an overdose of antidepressants. Drake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. Drake has come to be credited as an influence on numerous artists. The first Drake biography in English appeared in 1997; it was followed in 1999 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. Drake was born in Rangoon, Burma on 19 June 1948, a few months after the independence from the British Empire. Drake's father, Rodney Shuttleworth Drake, had moved to Rangoon in the early 1930s as an engineer with the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation. In 1934, Rodney Drake met Molly Lloyd, the daughter of a senior member of the Indian Civil Service. He proposed marriage in 1936, but the couple had to wait a year until she turned 21 before her family allowed them to marry. In 1951, the Drake family returned to England to live in Warwickshire, at their home, Far Leys, in Tanworth-in-Arden.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Like_Us,Not Like Us,Drake musician,"""Not Like Us"" is a diss track by the American rapper Kendrick Lamar released amidst his highly publicized feud with the Canadian rapper Drake. It was released on May 4, 2024, through Interscope Records, less than 20 hours after Lamar's previous diss track ""Meet the Grahams"". A music video, directed by Dave Free and Lamar, was released on American Independence Day. Primarily produced by Mustard, with additional work from Sounwave and Sean Momberger, ""Not Like Us"" is a hyphy-influenced West Coast hip-hop song composed of a prominent bassline with lively strings and finger snaps. Lyrically, it continues the themes introduced in ""Meet the Grahams"". Lamar doubles down on allegations of Drake's sexual interest in adolescents and sexual misconduct. He also criticizes his cultural identity and relationships with artists based in Atlanta, Georgia, accusing him of exploiting them for street credibility and financial gain. ""Not Like Us"" received acclaim from critics, who praised its production, songwriting, and Lamar's performance; they felt it solidified Lamar's victory. It is widely regarded as the feud's best track and one of the greatest diss tracks of all time. ""Not Like Us"" broke numerous records on the streaming platform Spotify and peaked at number one in ten countries, while charting in the top ten in over 20 additional countries. Drake responded to ""Not Like Us"" with ""The Heart Part 6"", in which he denied Lamar's accusations, on May 5. In January 2025, Drake filed a lawsuit against Interscope's parent Universal Music Group (UMG), alleging that ""Not Like Us"" defamed him and that UMG and Spotify artificially inflated its popularity. ""Not Like Us"" swept all five of its Grammy nominations at the 67th ceremony: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Music Video. It is tied with ""Up, Up and Away"" as the most-awarded song in Grammy history. Lamar first performed ""Not Like Us"" live on Juneteenth 2024 during The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, where he played it five consecutive times. In 2025, he performed it when he headlined the Super Bowl LIX halftime show and throughout his Grand National Tour.",2024 singles | 2024 songs | Billboard Global 200 number-one singles | Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles | Canadian Hot 100 number-one singles | Diss tracks | Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance | Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video,"2024, 2025",Background and release | Composition | Lyrics | Critical reception and analysis | Commercial performance | Global | United States | United Kingdom,"Released: May 4, 2024 (2024-05-04) | Genre: West Coast hip-hop

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs,List of pharaohs,Egyptian pharaohs Africa,"The title ""pharaoh"" is used for those rulers of Ancient Egypt who ruled after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer during the Early Dynastic Period, approximately 3100 BC. However, the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty, c. 1400 BC. Along with the title pharaoh for later rulers, there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a Horus name, a Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj) name and a Two Ladies (nbtj) name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties. Egypt was continually governed, at least in part, by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years, until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 8th century BC, whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest, Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire, whose rulers also adopted the title of pharaoh. The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II, who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time. Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC, after which it was ruled by Hellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Their rule, and the independence of Egypt, came to an end when Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were styled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD. The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate. They are based primarily on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt, mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately.",Pharaohs | Ancient Egypt-related lists | Lists of monarchs | Lists of monarchs in Africa | Lists of rulers of Egypt,1400,Ancient Egyptian king lists | Predynastic Period | Lower Egypt | Upper Egypt | Predynastic rulers: Dynasty 0 | Early Dynastic Period | First Dynasty | Second Dynasty,"Style: Five-name titulary | First monarch: Narmer or Menes(as King of Upper and Lower Egypt)

The 25th dynasty was a line of pharaohs who originated in the Kingdom of Kush, located in present-day northern Sudan and Upper Egypt. Most of this dynasty's kings saw Napata as their spiritual homeland. They reigned in part or all of Ancient Egypt for nearly a century, from 744 to 656 BC. The 25th dynasty was highly Egyptianized, using the Egyptian language and writing system as their medium of record and exhibiting an unusual devotion to Egypt's religious, artistic, and literary traditions. Earlier scholars have ascribed the origins of the dynasty to immigrants from Egypt, particularly the Egyptian Amun priests. The third intermediate-period Egyptian stimulus view is still maintained by prominent scholars, especially that excavations from el-Kurru cemetery, the key site to the origin of the Napata state, show sudden Egyptian arrivals and influence during the 3rd intermediate period, concurrent with the Egyptianization process. The 25th Dynasty's reunification of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Kush created the largest Egyptian empire since the New Kingdom. They assimilated into society by reaffirming Ancient Egyptian religious traditions, temples, and artistic forms, while introducing some unique aspects of Kushite culture. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in what is now Northern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.",Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt | States and territories established in the 8th century BC | States and territories disestablished in the 7th century BC | 740s BC | History of Nubia | Kingdom of Kush | Kings of Kush | Dynasties of ancient Egypt,,History | Piye | Shabaka and Shebitku Chronology Dispute | Shebitku | Shabaka | Taharqa | Tantamani | Armies of the 25th dynasty,"Capital: NapataMemphis | Common languages: Egyptian, Meroitic | Religion: Ancient Egyptian religion Kushite religion | Government: Monarchy",1730,2025-06-22 19:35:12

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_and_Lower_Egypt,Upper and Lower Egypt,Egyptian pharaohs Africa,"In Egyptian history, the Upper and Lower Egypt period (also known as The Two Lands) was the final stage of prehistoric Egypt and directly preceded the unification of the realm. The conception of Egypt as the Two Lands was an example of the dualism in ancient Egyptian culture and frequently appeared in texts and imagery, including in the titles of Egyptian pharaohs. The Egyptian title zmꜣ-tꜣwj (Egyptological pronunciation sema-tawy) is usually translated as ""Uniter of the Two Lands"" and was depicted as a human trachea entwined with the papyrus and lily plant. The trachea stood for unification, while the papyrus and lily plant represent Lower and Upper Egypt. Standard titles of the pharaoh included the prenomen, quite literally ""Of the Sedge and Bee"" (nswt-bjtj, the symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt) and ""lord of the Two Lands"" (written nb-tꜣwj). Queens regnant were addressed as pharaohs and male. Queens consort might use the feminine versions of the second title, ""lady of The Two Lands"" (nbt-tꜣwj), ""mistress of the Entire Two Lands"" (hnwt-tꜣwy-tm), and ""mistress of the Two Lands"" (hnwt-tꜣwy). Ancient Egypt was divided into two regions, namely Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. To the north was Lower Egypt, where the Nile stretched out with its several branches to form the Nile Delta. To the south was Upper Egypt, stretching to Aswan. The terminology ""Upper"" and ""Lower"" derives from the flow of the Nile from the highlands of East Africa northwards to the Mediterranean Sea. The two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united c. 3000 BC, but each maintained its own regalia: the hedjet or White Crown for Upper Egypt and the deshret or Red Crown for Lower Egypt. Thus, the pharaohs were known as the rulers of the Two Lands, and wore the pschent, a double crown, each half representing sovereignty of one of the kingdoms. Ancient Egyptian tradition credited Menes, now believed to be the same as Narmer, as the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt. On the Narmer Palette, the king is depicted wearing the Red Crown on one scene and the White crown in another, and thereby showing his rule over both Lands.",Geography of ancient Egypt | Prehistoric Egypt,,Structure | Sema Tawy and symbolism | See also | References,,2123,2025-06-22 19:35:15
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Egypt,History of ancient Egypt,Egyptian pharaohs Africa,"Ancient Egypt spans the period of Egyptian history from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The pharaonic period, the period in which Egypt was ruled by a pharaoh, is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule in 332 BC. Egypt's history is split into several different periods according to the ruling dynasty of each pharaoh. The dating of events is still a subject of research. The conservative dates are not supported by any reliable absolute date for a span of about three millennia. The following is the list according to conventional Egyptian chronology. The Nile has been the lifeline for Egyptian culture since nomadic hunter-gatherers began living along it during the Pleistocene. Traces of these early people appear in the form of artefacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the Nile and in the oases. Along the Nile in the 12th millennium BC, an Upper Paleolithic grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunting, fishing, and hunter-gatherers using stone tools. Despite evidence indicating human habitation and cattle herding in the southwestern corner of Egypt near the Sudan border before the 8th millennium BC, the idea of an independent bovine domestication event in Africa must be abandoned because subsequent evidence gathered over a period of thirty years has failed to corroborate this.",Ancient Egypt,,Chronology | Neolithic Egypt | Neolithic period | Prehistoric Egypt | Dynastic Egypt | Early dynastic period | Old Kingdom | First Intermediate Period,,1504,2025-06-22 19:35:16

The brutality of his murder and the acquittal of his killers drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the civil rights movement. Till was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. During summer vacation in August 1955, he was visiting relatives near Money, Mississippi, in the Mississippi Delta region. Till spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white, married proprietor of a local grocery store. Although what happened at the store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with, touching, or whistling at Bryant. Till's interaction with Bryant, perhaps unwittingly, violated the unwritten code of behavior for a black male interacting with a white female in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the encounter, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, who were armed, went to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted Till, age 14. They beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River.

In 1968, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which created a federal hate crime for persons that injure, intimidate, or interfere with selected minorities (including African Americans) while the victim was participating in certain enumerated activities (including voting, attending school, applying for a job, or serving on a jury).

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Emmett_Till,The Death of Emmett Till,Emmett Till,"""The Death of Emmett Till"", also known as ""The Ballad of Emmett Till"", is a song by the American musician Bob Dylan about the murder of Emmett Till. Till, a 14-year-old African American, was tortured and killed on August 28, 1955, by two white men, after being accused of disrespecting a white woman. In the song's lyrics, Dylan recounts the murder and trial. While the song never appeared on any of Dylan's studio albums, it did appear on a number of bootlegs. One bootlegged performance, which was recorded from Cynthia Gooding's radio show called Folksinger's Choice sometime in early 1962, starts with Dylan saying that the melody is based on chords he heard from folk musician Len Chandler. The melody is quite similar to ""The House of the Rising Sun"" from the album Bob Dylan. Dylan's performance of the song was released on the 1972 album Broadside Ballads, Vol. 6: Broadside Reunion, under the artist name Blind Boy Grunt. Another recording, taped as a demo for music publisher M. Witmark & Sons and also bootlegged for many years, was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 – The Witmark Demos: 1962–1964 in October 2010. Stephen J. Whitfield calls the lyrics ""mawkish"" but describes ""the ballad"" as ""a precocious attempt to continue the tradition of the folk protest song.""",Teenage tragedy songs | Bob Dylan songs | Songs written by Bob Dylan | 1962 songs | Murder ballads | Songs based on American history | Emmett Till,"2010, 1972, 1964, 1962, 1955",Background | Reception | See also | References | External links,Genre: Folk | Songwriter(s): Bob Dylan,1282,2025-06-22 19:39:01

It is based on the true story of Mamie Till, an educator and activist who pursued justice after the murder of her 14-year-old son Emmett in August 1955. The film stars Danielle Deadwyler as Mamie and Jalyn Hall as Emmett. Kevin Carroll, Frankie Faison, Haley Bennett, Jayme Lawson, Tosin Cole, Sean Patrick Thomas, John Douglas Thompson, Roger Guenveur Smith, and Goldberg also appear in supporting roles. The film was officially announced in August 2020, though a project about Emmett Till's murder had been in the works for several years prior. Much of the main cast joined the following summer, and filming took place in Bartow County, Georgia, that fall. It is the second major media property based on Mamie Till to be released in 2022, following the television series Women of the Movement. The film is dedicated in memory of Mamie Till's life and legacy and its release coincided with the October 2022 unveiling of a statue in Emmett Till's memory in Greenwood, Mississippi. Till had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 1, 2022, was theatrically released in the United States on October 14, 2022, by United Artists Releasing, and was released in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Deadwyler's performance, and was named one of the best films of 2022 by the National Board of Review. For her performance, Deadwyler received several awards, including nominations for the BAFTA, Critics' Choice and SAG Award for Best Actress. It grossed $11 million against a production budget of $20 million. In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till lived with his mother, Mamie, at 6427 South Saint Lawrence Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Before Emmett leaves to visit relatives in Money, Mississippi, Mamie warns him to be extra careful around white people. At a train station, the Tills meet with Mamie's uncle, Moses ""Preacher"" Wright, and Emmett's cousin, Wheeler Parker. After picking cotton on a sharecropper plantation, Emmett and his cousins purchase candy at the Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market. At the cash register, Emmett tells Carolyn Bryant that she looks like a movie star before showing her a photograph of a white girl in his wallet. Carolyn follows Emmett outside of the store, where he whistles at her.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Empire,Ethiopian Empire,Ethiopian Empire history,"The Ethiopian Empire,[a] historically known as Abyssinia or simply Ethiopia,[b] was a sovereign state that encompassed the present-day territories of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It existed from the establishment of the Solomonic dynasty by Yekuno Amlak around 1270 until the 1974 coup d'état by the Derg, which ended the reign of the final Emperor, Haile Selassie. In the late 19th century, under Emperor Menelik II, the empire expanded significantly to the south, and in 1952, Eritrea was federated under Selassie's rule. Despite being surrounded by hostile forces throughout much of its history, the empire maintained a kingdom centered on its ancient Christian heritage. Founded in 1270 by Yekuno Amlak, who claimed to descend from the last Aksumite king and ultimately King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, it replaced the Agaw kingdom of the Zagwe. While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity, the Empire managed to expand significantly under the crusades of Amda Seyon I (1314–1344) and Dawit I (1382–1413), temporarily becoming the dominant force in the Horn of Africa. The Ethiopian Empire would reach its peak during the long reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob (1434–1468). He consolidated the conquests of his predecessors, built numerous churches and monasteries, encouraged literature and art, centralized imperial authority by substituting regional warlords with administrative officials, and significantly expanded his hegemony over adjacent Islamic territories. The neighboring Muslim Adal Sultanate began to threaten the empire by repeatedly attempting to invade it, finally succeeding under Imam Mahfuz. Mahfuz's ambush and defeat by Emperor Lebna Dengel brought about the early 16th-century jihad of the Ottoman-supported Adalite Imam Ahmed Gran, who was defeated in 1543 with the help of the Portuguese. Greatly weakened, much of the Empire's southern territory and vassals were lost due to the Oromo migrations. In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse Ottoman invasion attempts, although losing its access to the Red Sea to them. Reacting to these challenges, in the 1630s Emperor Fasilides founded the new capital of Gondar, marking the start of a new golden age known as the Gondarine period. It saw relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor Iyasu II (1755) and Iyoas I (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as the Zemene Mesafint where regio",Ethiopian Empire | Countries in precolonial Africa | Christian states | 2nd millennium in Ethiopia | 1270 establishments | 13th-century establishments in Africa | 1974 disestablishments in Ethiopia | Former countries in Africa,"1270, 1468, 1413, 1434, 1344, 1974, 1314, 1382, 1952",History | Background | Early Solomonic Period | Early modern period | Modern era | Italian invasion and World War II | Post War Ethiopia | Fall of monarchy,"Capital: None[note 1] (1270–1635)Gondar (1635–1855)Debre Tabor (1855–1881)Mekelle (1881–1889)Addis Ababa (1889–1974) | Common languages: Amharic (dynastic, official, court)[3][4]Ge'ez (liturgical language, literature)many others",2568,2025-06-22 19:35:30

The organization existed in multiple forms throughout the history of the Ethiopian Empire from its foundation in 1270 by Emperor Yekuno Amlak, to the overthrow of the monarchy and Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 by members of the Ethiopian army. Due to the country's position along multiple trade routes and its maintenance of independence against multiple Islamic and colonialist invasions lead to multiple conflicts against numerous major countries including the Ottomans, Egyptians, British, and Italians. European contact with the Ethiopians in the 1500s brought the first firearms to the country although attempts to arm the imperial army with gunpowder weapons did not happen until the early 1800s. The Ethiopians attempted to develop modern weapons internally, but after a British expedition to the country resulted in the death of an emperor and an Ethiopian defeat, the empire increased its importation of weaponry. The method of raising a national army was also altered in the 1800s with a centralized permanent field army being established. Unlike the majority of non-European armies, the Ethiopian army was able to successfully modernize in the late 19th century and saved the country from European colonialism until another Italian invasion in the 1930s. After regaining independence in 1941, the military saw massive modernization programs under the guidance of the British and Americans and served minor roles in international conflicts until internal conflicts diverted Ethiopia's foreign policy. In 1306, diplomatic envoys from Ethiopia arrived in Rome seeking diplomatic relations. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias completed the first circumvention of the African continent reaching India and opening relations between the Portuguese and multiple African countries, including Ethiopia. In 1488, Ethiopian diplomats arrived in Lisbon, Portugal and Jesuit missionaries came to Ethiopia where they remained until their expulsion by Emperor Fasilides in 1632. Emperor Yeshaq I, according to the Islamic historian al-Maqrizi, hired a group of Mamluks led by al-Tabingha to train his army in gunnery and sword fighting.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ethiopia,History of Ethiopia,Ethiopian Empire history,"Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in Africa; the emergence of Ethiopian civilization dates back thousands of years. Abyssinia or rather ""Ze Etiyopia"" was ruled by the Semitic Abyssinians (Habesha) composed mainly of the Amhara, Tigrayans and the Cushitic Agaw. In the Eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian highlands and more so the lowlands were the home of the Harari/Harla that founded Sultanates such as Ifat and Adal and the Afars. In the central and south were found the ancient Sidama and Semitic Gurage, among others. One of the first kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of D'mt in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at Yeha. In the first century AD, the Aksumite Kingdom rose to power in the modern Tigray Region with its capital at Aksum and grew into a major power on the Red Sea, subjugating South Arabia and Meroe and its surrounding areas. In the early fourth century, during the reign of Ezana, Christianity was declared the state religion and not long after, The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum.[citation needed] It eventually became isolated, its economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region ended. The Aksumites gave way to the Zagwe dynasty, who established a new capital at Lalibela before giving way to the Solomonic dynasty in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia underwent military reforms and imperial expansion, allowing it to dominate the Horn of Africa. The Greek name Αἰθιοπία (from Αἰθίοψ, Aithiops, ""an Ethiopian"") is a compound word, later explained as derived from the Greek words αἴθω and ὤψ (aithō ""I burn"" + ōps ""face""). According to the Liddell-Scott Jones Greek-English Lexicon, the designation properly translates as burnt-face in noun form and red-brown in adjectival form. The historian Herodotus used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa south of the Sahara that were then known within the Ecumene (habitable world). The earliest mention of the term is found in the works of Homer, where it is used to refer to two people groups, one in Africa and one in the east from eastern Turkey to India. In ancient times, the name Ethiopia was primarily used about the modern-day nation of Sudan which is based in the Upper Nile valley and is located south of Egypt, also called Kush, and then secondarily about Sub-Saharan Africa in general.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian–Ethiopian_War,Egyptian–Ethiopian War,Ethiopian Empire history,"Ethiopian victory The Egyptian–Ethiopian War was a war between the Ethiopian Empire and the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, from 1874 to 1876. The conflict resulted in an unequivocal Ethiopian victory that guaranteed continued independence of Ethiopia in the years immediately preceding the Scramble for Africa. Conversely, for Egypt the war was a costly failure, severely blunting the regional aspirations of Egypt as an African empire, and laying the foundations for the beginning of the British Empire's 'veiled protectorate' over Egypt less than a decade later. Whilst nominally a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt had acted as a virtually independent state since Muhammad Ali's seizure of power in 1805, eventually establishing an empire to its south in Sudan. Multiple times throughout the early 19th century, Ottoman Egypt attempted to assert their control over the region around the modern Ethiopian-Sudanese border, putting them into conflict with the regional rulers of Ethiopia's western Begemder province, such as at Kalnabu, Wadkaltabu, Gallabat, and Dabarki. Muhammad Ali's grandson, Isma'il Pasha, became Khedive in 1863, and sought to expand this burgeoning empire further southwards. After annexing Darfur in 1875, he turned his attention to Ethiopia. It was Isma'il's intention that Egypt forge a contiguous African empire that would both rival the empires of Europe, and allow Egypt to escape the territorial ambitions of those same European great powers. In addition to expanding into modern-day Chad, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, and Uganda, he wished to absorb within his empire the entirety of the Nile Valley, including Ethiopia, the source of the Blue Nile. Whilst Ethiopia's history mirrored that of Egypt in many respects, with both having ancient, continuous civilizations home to both Muslims and Orthodox Christians, the rapid modernization of Egypt under Muhammad Ali, and Isma'il's own enormous modernizing projects, convinced the Khedive that war with Ethiopia would result in certain Egyptian victory. Amongst Egypt's army were many European and American officers, whose training and experience further strengthened Isma'il's confidence. Meanwhile, King Yohannes IV became the King of kings of Ethiopia in 1872 after defeating Tekle Giyorgis II in battle. He worked on modernizing his army, some of whom were trained by the British adventurer John Kirkham.

'Conquest of Abyssinia'), was a war fought between the Christian Ethiopian Empire and the Muslim Adal Sultanate from 1529 to 1543. The Christian Ethiopian troops consisted of the Amhara, Tigrayans, Tigrinya and Agaw people, and at the closing of the war, supported by the Portuguese Empire with no less than four hundred musketeers. The Adal forces were composed of Harla/Harari, Somali, Afar, as well as Arab and Turkish gunmen. Both sides would see the Maya mercenaries at times join their ranks.: 188 The conflict was followed shortly by the 16th century Ottoman-Ethiopian War Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi was a military leader of the medieval Adal Sultanate in the northern Horn of Africa. Between 1529 and 1543, he embarked on a campaign referred to as the Futuh Al-Habash, bringing the three-quarters of Christian Abyssinia under the control of the Muslim empire. With an army composed of Afar, Harari (Harla), and Somalis, al-Ghazi's forces came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, slaughtering any Ethiopian who refused to convert to Islam. Within the span of fourteen years the Imam was able to conquer the heartland of the country, wreaking havoc on the Christian nation. However, the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of Cristóvão da Gama's Portuguese troops, and maintained their domain's autonomy. Both polities exhausted their resources and manpower in the process, resulting in the contraction of the two powers and altering regional dynamics for centuries to come. Many historians trace the origin of hostile Ethiopia–Somalia relations to this war. Some scholars also argue that this conflict proved the value, through their use on both sides, of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons, and the arquebus over traditional weapons. In 1529, Imam Ahmad's Adal troops defeated a larger Ethiopian contingent at the Battle of Shimbra Kure. The Harari cavalry also known as the Malassay were instrumental in this battle, as the Abyssinian troops were outmaneuvered. According to William Cornwallis Harris the Adal army was given Janissaries by the Ottoman Empire from the beginning of the conflict. The victories that gave the followers of Imam Ahmad the upper hand came in 1531. The first was the Battle of Antukyah, where cannon fire at the start panicked the Ethiopian soldiers. The second was the Battle of Amba Sel, where troops under the",Ethiopian–Adal War | Conflicts in 1543 | Conflicts in 1529 | Wars involving the Adal Sultanate | Invasions of Ethiopia | Wars involving the Ottoman Empire | Wars involving Portugal | Wars involving the Ethiopian Empire,"1529, 1543, 1531",Background | Course of the war | Aftermath | See also | References,"Date: Date9 March 1529 – 21 February 1543(13 years, 11 months, 1 week and 5 days)LocationEthiopia, Eritrea, SomaliaResult

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrobeat,Afrobeat,Fela Kuti Afrobeat,"Afrobeat (also known as Afrofunk) is a West African music genre, fusing influences from Nigerian (such as Yoruba) and Ghanaian (such as highlife) music, with American funk, jazz, and soul influences. With a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion, the style was pioneered in the 1960s by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, who popularised it both within and outside Nigeria. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most ""challenging and charismatic music performers."" Distinct from Afrobeat is Afrobeats, a combination of sounds originating in West Africa in the 21st century. This takes on diverse influences and is an eclectic combination of genres such as hip hop, house, jùjú, ndombolo, R&B, soca, and dancehall. The two genres, though often conflated, are not the same. Afrobeat evolved in Nigeria in the late 1960s by Fela Anikulapo Kuti, (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun) who, with drummer Tony Allen, experimented with different contemporary music of that time. Afrobeat was influenced by a combination of different genres, such as highlife, fuji, and jùjú, as well as Yoruba vocal traditions, rhythm, and instruments. In the late 1950s, Kuti left Lagos to study abroad at the London School of Music, where he took lessons in piano and percussion and was exposed to jazz. Fela Kuti returned to Lagos and played a highlife-jazz hybrid, albeit, without commercial success. In 1969, Kuti and his band went on a trip to the U.S. and met a woman by the name of Sandra Smith, a singer and former Black Panther. Sandra Smith (now known as Sandra Izsadore or Sandra Akanke Isidore) introduced Kuti to many writings of activists such as Martin Luther King Jr., Angela Davis, Jesse Jackson, and his biggest influence of all, Malcolm X.",Afrobeat | 20th-century music genres | 21st-century music genres | African popular music | Fela Kuti | Music of the African diaspora | Nigerian styles of music | Yoruba music,1969,History | Influence | See also | References | External links,"Stylistic origins: West African musichighlifeYoruba musicfunkjazzsoulfuji musicAfro-Cuban music | Cultural origins: 1960s, Nigeria | Typical instruments: Bass guitarsakara drumdrumsguitarhornsHammond organkeyboardspercussionOgenesaxophoneshekerevocals [1][2] | Derivative forms: Afrobeats",1815,2025-06-22 19:36:16

His mother soon left his father, taking Femi to live with her. In 1977, however, Femi chose to move in with his father. Femi started playing the saxophone at the age of 15 and eventually became a member of his father's band. He studied at Baptist Academy and Igbobi College. Like his father, Femi has made commitments to social and political causes throughout his career. Femi's grandmother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a political campaigner and women's rights activist.

He is regarded as the principal innovator of Afrobeat, a Nigerian music genre that combines West African music with American funk and jazz. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most ""challenging and charismatic music performers"". AllMusic described him as ""a musical and sociopolitical voice"" of international significance. Kuti was the son of Nigerian women's rights activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. After early experiences abroad, he and his band Africa '70 (featuring drummer and musical director Tony Allen) shot to stardom in Nigeria during the 1970s, during which he was an outspoken critic and target of Nigeria's military juntas. In 1970, he founded the Kalakuta Republic commune, which declared itself independent from military rule. The commune was destroyed in a 1978 army raid that injured Kuti and his mother, the latter fatally. He was jailed by the government of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984, but released after 20 months. He continued to record and perform through the 1980s and 1990s. Since his death in 1997, reissues and compilations of his music have been overseen by his son, Femi Kuti. Kuti was born into the Ransome-Kuti family, an upper-middle-class family, on 15 October 1938, in Abeokuta, Colonial Nigeria. His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist, and his father, Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister, school principal, and the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. Kuti's parents both played active roles in the anti-colonial movement in Nigeria, most notably the Abeokuta Women's Riots which were led by his mother in 1946. His brothers Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, were well known nationally. Kuti is a cousin to the writer and laureate Wole Soyinka, a Nobel Prize for Literature winner. They are both descendants of Josiah Ransome-Kuti, who is Kuti's paternal grandfather and Soyinka's maternal great-grandfather. Kuti attended Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1958, he was sent to London to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, with the trumpet being his preferred instrument. While there, he formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife. The ensemble would include members, Bayo Martins on drums and Wole Bucknor on piano.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest,Ferguson unrest,Ferguson protests 2014,"The Ferguson unrest (sometimes called the Ferguson uprising, Ferguson protests, or the Ferguson riots) was a series of protests and riots which began in Ferguson, Missouri on August 10, 2014, the day after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by FPD officer Darren Wilson. The unrest sparked a vigorous debate in the United States about the relationship between law enforcement officers and Black Americans, the militarization of police, and the use-of-force law in Missouri and nationwide. Continuing activism expanded the issues by including modern-day debtors prisons, for-profit policing, and school segregation. As the details of the shooting emerged, police established curfews and deployed riot squads in anticipation of unrest. Along with peaceful protests, there was a significant amount of looting and violence in the vicinity of the site of the shooting, as well as across the city. Media criticism of the militarization of the police in Ferguson after the shooting was frequent. The unrest continued on November 24, 2014, after a grand jury did not indict Officer Wilson. It briefly flared again on the first anniversary of Brown's shooting. The Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense. In response to the shooting and the subsequent unrest, the DOJ conducted an investigation into the policing practices of the Ferguson Police Department (FPD). In March 2015, the DOJ announced that they had determined that the FPD had engaged in misconduct against the citizenry of Ferguson by, among other things, discriminating against African Americans and applying racial stereotypes in a ""pattern or practice of unlawful conduct."" The DOJ also found that the Ferguson city council relied on fines and other charges generated by police for funding municipal services. Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American male, was shot and killed during an encounter with Officer Darren Wilson. Officer Wilson arrived after a robbery and assault was reported at a nearby convenience store. The caller described the accused (later identified as Michael Brown from security cameras). Officer Wilson's account was that after seeing Brown and Brown's friend Dorian Johnson walking home in the middle of the street he asked them to walk on the sidewalk instead. When they refused Wilson noticed that Brown's shirt and a box of cigarillos he was holding matched the description from the robbery call, and suspected Brown and Johnson as being involved.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown,Killing of Michael Brown,Ferguson protests 2014,"On August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Brown was accompanied by his 22-year-old male friend Dorian Johnson. Wilson, a white male Ferguson police officer, said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked him in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's service pistol. The struggle continued until the pistol fired. Johnson said that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through Wilson's patrol car window, threatening him and then shooting at him. At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back. According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car. Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body. This event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Witnesses to the shooting claimed Brown had his hands up in surrender or said ""don't shoot"", so protesters later used the slogan ""Hands up, don't shoot"". A subsequent FBI investigation said that there was no evidence that Brown had done so. Peaceful protests and violent riots continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later established a nightly curfew. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. A grand jury was called and given evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson. In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It claimed that Wilson's account was ""corroborated by bruising on Wilson's jaw and scratches on his neck, the presence of Brown's DNA on Wilson's collar, shirt and pants, and Wilson's DNA on Brown's palm"", and claimed that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible.

The movement became notable after organizing protests that gained national attention following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. In October 2014, the movement organized a four-day event, called the Weekend of Resistance, in which more than 1000 protestors from across the United States marched in downtown St. Louis. Ferguson October was organized by the Organization for Black Struggle, Hands Up United, Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment and local activists including Tef Poe, Taurean Russell and Ashley Yates. Several other activist groups from across the United States supported the effort with rallies in their cities. One of the movement's objectives is for police officer Darren Wilson to be criminally charged for the shooting death of Michael Brown. In November 2014, Ferguson October was relaunched as Ferguson Action and coordinated a series of actions across the country after the Grand Jury declined to indict Officer Wilson.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests,June 2025 Los Angeles protests,Ferguson protests 2014,"On June 6, 2025, protests erupted in Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided several city locations to arrest individuals allegedly involved in illegal immigration to the United States. Some protests turned into riots after protestors clashed with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and ICE,[a] but most remained peaceful and occurred within a roughly five-block stretch of downtown Los Angeles.[b] On June 7, protestors and federal law enforcement agents clashed in Paramount and Compton during raids. President Donald Trump responded by federalizing the California National Guard, calling for 2,000 guard members to deploy to the city under Joint Task Force 51. Protests have been organized and attended by multiple groups and unaffiliated protestors. On June 9, the president authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members, and the Pentagon activated 700 Marines to deploy to the city, who arrived the next day. Critics, including California governor Gavin Newsom (who has sued Trump over the federalization), described the military response as premature, inflammatory, for political gain, and authoritarian, creating debate about military response to protest versus controlling protest with police. A number of demonstrators have been arrested and multiple law enforcement officers and protesters have been injured. The anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles have inspired additional anti-ICE protests in other U.S. cities, such as New York, Chicago, and Dallas. Protests and movements against ICE have been seen throughout the United States, with a major movement seen in Abolish ICE, which gained mainstream traction in June 2018, following the Trump administration family separation policy. Prior protests against ICE and anti-mass deportations were seen in California in February 2025, shortly after Donald Trump's election in the 2024 United States presidential election.","2025 controversies in the United States | 2025 in American politics | 2025 in Los Angeles | 2025 protests | 2025 riots | Compton, California | Gavin Newsom | Hispanic and Latino American history of California","2024, 2025, 2018",Background | Events | June 6 | June 7 | June 8 | June 9 | June 10 | June 11,"Date: June 6, 2025 – present(2 weeks and 2 days) | Location: Los Angeles County, California, U.S. | Caused by: Deportation in the second presidency of Donald Trump | Methods: Demonstrations

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_Syllabus,Ferguson Syllabus,Ferguson protests 2014,"In the wake of civil unrest and protests in Ferguson, Missouri, Professor Marcia Chatelain of Georgetown University created the #FergusonSyllabus Twitter campaign. Ferguson syllabus provides a space for educators to discuss integrating the events that happened in Ferguson into classrooms. On August 9, 2014 an unarmed Black teenager, Michael Brown, was fatally shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. The disputed details of Brown's death sparked protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, across the United States, and internationally. The dispute arose from dueling narratives of why and how the altercation occurred. Wilson and eyewitnesses presented different accounts of what happened. This confusion, along with aggressive policing following Brown's death, led to heated debate and examination of the relationship between policing practices and communities of color. The protests and civil unrest continued on November 24, 2014 after a St. Louis grand jury failed to indict Wilson on criminal charges. After the verdict was announced, protests flared in Ferguson and in nearly every major U.S. city. On November 29, 2014, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department with no severance or benefits. Over $500,000 was raised by Wilson's supporters via crowdfunding. On March 4, 2015 the United States Department of Justice announced the findings of its two civil rights investigations into the Ferguson Police Department. The Justice Department found that the Ferguson Police Department ""engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments of the Constitution"". In Ferguson—a city with a population of 21,000–16,000 people have outstanding arrest warrants, meaning that they are currently actively wanted by the police. The Justice Department also stated, ""That the evidence examined in its independent, federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown does not support federal civil rights charges against Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson."" Ferguson Syllabus is a crowdsourced syllabus about race, African-American history, civil rights, and policing. It was created as a way to integrate conversations of what happened in Ferguson into classrooms.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass,Frederick Douglass,Frederick Douglass,"Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, c. February 14, 1818[a] – February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. He was the most important leader of the movement for African-American civil rights in the 19th century. After escaping from slavery in Maryland in 1838, Douglass became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York and gained fame for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. Accordingly, he was described by abolitionists in his time as a living counterexample to claims by supporters of slavery that enslaved people lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been enslaved. It was in response to this disbelief that Douglass wrote his first autobiography. Douglass wrote three autobiographies, describing his experiences as an enslaved person in his Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845), which became a bestseller and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, My Bondage and My Freedom (1855). Following the Civil War, Douglass was an active campaigner for the rights of freed slaves and wrote his last autobiography, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, the book covers his life up to those dates. Douglass also actively supported women's suffrage, and he held several public offices. Without his knowledge or consent, Douglass became the first African American nominated for vice president of the United States, as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull on the Equal Rights Party ticket. Douglass believed in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, as well as, after breaking with William Lloyd Garrison, in the anti-slavery interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. When radical abolitionists, under the motto ""No Union with Slaveholders"", criticized Douglass's willingness to engage in dialogue with slave owners, he replied: ""I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.""",Frederick Douglass | 1810s births | 1872 United States vice-presidential candidates | 1895 deaths | 19th-century African-American businesspeople | 19th-century African-American writers | 19th-century American businesspeople | 19th-century American diplomats,"1818, 1892, 1881, 1838, 1855, 1895, 1845",Early life and slavery | Birth family | Early learning and experience | Escape from slavery | Religious views | Family life | Career | Abolitionist and preacher,Appointed by: Benjamin Harrison | Preceded by: John E.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Frederick_Douglass,Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,Frederick Douglass,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave is an 1845 memoir and treatise on abolition written by African-American orator and former slave Frederick Douglass during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts. It is the first of Douglass's three autobiographies, the others being My Bondage and My Freedom (1855) and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (1881, revised 1892). Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is generally held to be the most famous of a number of narratives written by former slaves during the same period. In factual detail, the text describes the events of his life and is considered to be one of the most influential pieces of literature to fuel the abolitionist movement of the early 19th century in the United States. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass comprises eleven chapters that recount Douglass's life as a slave and his ambition to become a free man. It contains two introductions by well-known white abolitionists: a preface by William Lloyd Garrison and a letter by Wendell Phillips, both arguing for the veracity of the account and the literacy of its author. Douglass begins by explaining that he does not know the date of his birth (in his third autobiography, he wrote, ""I suppose myself to have been born in February 1817""), and that his mother died when he was 7 years old. He has very few memories of her (children were commonly separated from their mothers), only of the rare nighttime visit. He thinks his father is a white man, possibly his owner. At a very early age, he sees his Aunt Hester being whipped. Douglass details the cruel interaction that occurs between slaves and slaveholders, as well as how slaves are supposed to behave in the presence of their masters. Douglass says that fear is what kept many slaves in servitude, for when they told the truth they were punished by their owners. Douglass is moved to Baltimore, Maryland. He believes that if he had not been moved, he would have remained a slave his entire life. He starts to hope for a better future. He discusses the wife of his new owner, Sophia Auld, who initially is kind to him but later turns cruel. Initially, she teaches Douglass the alphabet and how to spell small words, but her husband, Hugh Auld, disapproves and states that if slaves could read, they would not be fit to be slaves, being unmanageable and sad. (Anti-literacy laws also prohibited teaching antebellum slaves to read and write.)

It was located in the Brush Park section on the east side of Detroit, Michigan, United States, near the Chrysler Freeway, Mack Avenue and St. Antoine Street. The housing project is named after Brewster Street, which ran through the area, and Frederick Douglass, African American abolitionist, author, and reformer. It was demolished in phases between 2003 and 2014. The complex was home to such notable figures as Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, Loni Love, and Etterlene DeBarge, during their early years. Hastings Street, originally the center of the Jewish community in Detroit, had become the center of Black culture in Detroit between the 1920s and the 1950s. Located at the southern edge of the future Brewster-Douglass Homes, the street was the home of innumerable salons and entertainment venues. With the addition of the high-rises and an influx of people moving into the housing, Hastings Street was billed as the place one could fulfill any conceivable need. Hastings Street was most famously referenced in the John Lee Hooker song ""Boogie Chillen'"". The Brewster Project and Frederick Douglass Apartments were built between 1935 and 1955. They were designed by Harley, Ellington & Day of Detroit. The Brewster Project began construction in 1935, when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt broke ground for the 701-unit development. The first phase, consisting of low-rise apartment blocks, was completed in 1938. An expansion of the project completed in 1941 brought the total number of housing units to 941. The Frederick Douglass Apartments, built immediately to the south of the Brewster Project, began construction in 1942. Apartment rows, two 6-story low-rises, and six 14-story high rises were completed between 1952 and 1955.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk,Funk,Funk music history,"Funk is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African-Americans in the mid-20th century. It deemphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a percussionist, often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a ""hypnotic"" and ""danceable"" feel. It uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, and dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths. Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure (""The One""), and the application of swung 16th notes and syncopation on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs. Rock- and psychedelia-influenced musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s. Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including Kool and the Gang, Ohio Players, Fatback Band, Jimmy Castor Bunch, Earth, Wind & Fire, B.T. Express, Shalamar, One Way, Lakeside, Dazz Band, The Gap Band, Slave, Aurra, Roger Troutman & Zapp, Con Funk Shun, Cameo, Bar-Kays, The Brothers Johnson and Chic. Funk derivatives include avant-funk, an avant-garde strain of funk; boogie, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal; G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and psychedelic funk; Timba, a form of funky Cuban dance music; and funk jam. It is also the main influence of Washington go-go, a funk subgenre. Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and electronic dance music. The word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin fumigare (which means ""to smoke"") via Old French fungiere and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784, funky meaning ""musty"" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of ""earthy"" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something ""deeply or strongly felt"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_funk,Psychedelic funk,Funk music history,"Psychedelic funk (also called P-funk or funkadelia, and sometimes conflated with psychedelic soul) is a music genre that combines funk music with elements of psychedelic rock. It was pioneered in the late 1960s and early 1970s by American acts like Sly and the Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and the Parliament-Funkadelic collective. It would influence subsequent styles including 1970s jazz fusion and the 1990s West Coast hip hop style G-funk. Inspired by Jimi Hendrix and psychedelic culture, the psychedelic soul group Sly and the Family Stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz boxes, echo chambers, and vocal distorters. On albums such as Life (1968) and Stand (1969), the band pioneered a ""multiculturalist, integrationist"" psychedelic funk style. This psychedelic sound would also be reflected in the late 1960s output of iconic Detroit label Motown. Producer Norman Whitfield drew on this sound for popular Motown recordings such as The Temptations' ""Cloud Nine"" and Marvin Gaye's ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine,"" both released in October 1968. Hendrix's November 1968 single ""Crosstown Traffic"" has been described as an early example of the psychedelic funk subgenre. In 1970, Hendrix released the trio album Band of Gypsys, described as ""ground zero"" for psychedelic funk. The Parliament-Funkadelic collective developed the sensibility, employing acid rock-oriented guitar and synthesizers into open-ended funk jams. Funkadelic's 1971 album Maggot Brain was labeled a monument in the genre by Pitchfork. Led by George Clinton, P-Funk would shift the genre away from song-form and toward groove and texture, emphasizing the abject elements of psychedelia. The Isley Brothers and Bobby Womack would be influenced by Funkadelic and draw on this sound. Womack also contributed to Sly and the Family Stone's landmark 1971 album There's a Riot Goin' On, described as a ""masterpiece of darkly psychedelic funk"" by AllMusic. During the early 1970s, the main elements of psychedelic funk were adopted as signifiers of ""urban blackness"" and incorporated into blaxploitation films. The 1971 James Brown instrumental album Sho Is Funky Down Here, directed by bandleader David Matthews, explored ""fuzzy"" psychedelic funk. Jazz musician Miles Davis, newly influenced by Sly Stone and Brown, explored the genre on his 1972 album On the Corner. The group War recorded in a psychedelic funk-rock style alongside lyrics protesting racism and police brutality.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-funk,G-funk,Funk music history,"G-funk, short for gangsta funk, (or funk rap) is a sub-genre of gangsta rap that emerged from the West Coast scene in the early 1990s. The genre is heavily influenced by the synthesizer-heavy 1970s funk sound of Parliament-Funkadelic (aka P-Funk), often incorporated through samples or re-recordings. It is represented by commercially successful albums such as Dr. Dre's The Chronic (1992), Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle (1993), and 2Pac's All Eyez on Me (1996). G-funk, which uses funk with an artificially altered tempo, incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, heavy use of the snare drum, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. G-funk is typically set at between 90 and 100 BPM. The lyrical content depended on the artist; it could consist of sex, drug use (especially marijuana), love for a city, and love for friends. There was also a slurred ""lazy"" or ""smooth"" way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence. Many R&B and pop singles of the 1990s incorporated the G-funk sound to their music. The trademark West Coast G-funk style of hip-hop was a very defining element of the region's music. The genre helped distinguish West Coast hip-hop from the rivaling rap scene on the East Coast. In essence, the smooth, slow-tempo sound of G-funk accompanied the perceived ""laid-back"" stereotype of Californian culture whereas East Coast hip-hop typically featured more aggressive attitudes alongside a fast-paced tempo (e.g. hardcore hip-hop). Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per song. Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as ""a style of generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and harmonies"". Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the sample. Although it is a predominantly West Coast sound, one of the earliest examples of hip-hop making strong use of synths over funky samples is ""The R""; the track was released in mid-1988 by New York duo Eric B. & Rakim.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_metal,Funk metal,Funk music history,"Funk metal (also known as thrash-funk or punk-funk) is a subgenre of funk rock and alternative metal that infuses heavy metal music (often thrash metal) with elements of funk and punk rock. Funk metal was part of the alternative metal movement, and has been described as a ""brief but extremely media-hyped stylistic fad"". The funk metal scene formed in California during the mid-1980s with a group of bands who were initially playing a mix of funk, hard rock, hip hop and punk; the genre quickly evolved to include elements of thrash metal. Funk metal has also been called thrash-funk or punk-funk. It was most prevalent in the American state of California, particularly in Los Angeles and San Francisco. According to AllMusic, funk metal ""takes the loud guitars and riffs of heavy metal and melds them to the popping bass lines and syncopated rhythms of funk"". They go on to state ""funk metal evolved in the mid-'80s when alternative bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone began playing the hybrid with a stronger funk underpinning than metal. The bands that followed relied more on metal than funk, though they retained the wild bass lines."" Faith No More, another Californian alternative group who emerged in the mid-1980s, have been described as a funk metal band that also dabbled in rap metal. Rage Against the Machine's mix of funk and metal not only included rap, but also elements of hardcore. AllMusic formerly categorized funk metal as a style of alternative rock, in spite of the genre's name. The website currently categorizes it as a style of heavy metal. Certain bands not from a punk/alternative background, such as glam metal groups Bang Tango and Extreme, have also frequently incorporated funk into their musical style.

James Brown and others declared that Little Richard and his mid-1950s road band, the Upsetters, were the first to put the funk in the rock and roll beat, with a biographer stating that their music ""spark[ed] the musical transition from fifties rock and roll to sixties funk"". Funk rock's earliest incarnation on record was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as Sly and the Family Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic, The Isley Brothers, Redbone, Rick Derringer, David Bowie, Defunkt, The Chambers Brothers, Cold Blood, Shuggie Otis, James Gang, Rare Earth (band), Graham Central Station, Wild Cherry, the Average White Band, James Blood Ulmer, Gary Wright, Black Merda, Bar-Kays, Edwin Birdsong, Betty Davis, and Mother's Finest.

Groups including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine, Incubus, Mr. Bungle, Primus and Faith No More also notably combined funk rock with metal, punk, hip hop and experimental music, leading to the emergence of the genre known as funk metal or ""punk-funk"". Funk rock is a fusion of funk music and rock music also from the point of view of instrumentation, in fact it incorporates that of both genres into itself, and the overall sound is shaped by a definitive bass or drum beat and by electric guitars.

Derek Chauvin, one of four police officers who arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for over nine minutes, fatally asphyxiating him. After his murder, a series of protests against police brutality, especially towards black people, quickly spread globally and across the United States. His dying words, ""I can't breathe"", became a rallying slogan. Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Floyd grew up in Houston, Texas, playing football and basketball throughout high school and college. Between 1997 and 2005, he was convicted of eight crimes. He served four years in prison after accepting a plea bargain for a 2007 aggravated robbery in a home invasion. After he was paroled in 2013, he served as a mentor in his religious community and posted anti-violence videos to social media. In 2014, he moved to the Minneapolis area, residing in the nearby suburb of St. Louis Park, and worked as a truck driver and bouncer. In 2020, he lost both jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. After his death, the City of Minneapolis settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Floyd's family for $27 million. Chauvin was convicted on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter on April 20, 2021, and on June 25, 2021, was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 years in prison. The other three officers at the scene were also later convicted of violating Floyd's civil rights.

Floyd had been arrested after a store clerk reported that he made a purchase using a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face-down in a street. Two other police officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, assisted Chauvin in restraining Floyd. Lane had also pointed a gun at Floyd's head before Floyd was handcuffed. A fourth police officer, Tou Thao, prevented bystanders from intervening. Before being placed on the ground, Floyd had exhibited signs of anxiety, complaining about having claustrophobia, and being unable to breathe. After being restrained, he became more distressed, still complaining of breathing difficulties, of the knee on his neck, and of fear of imminent death. After several minutes, Floyd stopped speaking. For the last few minutes, he lay motionless, and Kueng found no pulse when urged to check. Despite this, Chauvin ignored bystanders' pleas to lift his knee from Floyd's neck. The next day, after videos recorded by witnesses and security cameras became public, the Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers. Two autopsies, and one autopsy review, found Floyd's death to be a homicide. On March 12, 2021, Minneapolis agreed to pay US$27 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Floyd's family. On April 20, Chauvin was convicted of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, and on June 25 he was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 years in prison.

The protests began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, the day after George Floyd, an African-American man, was murdered by Derek Chauvin during a police arrest. On June 6, an estimated half a million people joined protests in 550 places across the country. Protests continued through the weekend of June 19, overlapping with and bringing awareness to observations of Juneteenth. Protests had continued throughout the entire month of June in many cities, with protests occurring in over 40% of counties in the United States. Polls estimate between 15 million and 26 million people participated in the United States, making these protests potentially the largest movement in terms of participation in U.S. history. The riots cause an estimated $1-2 billion in claimed insurance damages nationwide. The protests spread to over 2,000 cities and towns in all 50 states and all 5 permanently-inhabited territories, as well as in over 60 other countries, with demonstrators supporting those seeking justice for Floyd and the wider Black Lives Matter movement, and speaking out against police brutality. Many protests were accompanied by violence with some large cities seeing large scale rioting, looting, and burning of businesses and police cars. There were also many instances of police brutality. The wave of protests and unrest has been compared to the long, hot summer of 1967 and the King assassination riots, both of which saw riots in over 10 cities across the United States. Outside the United States, protests against the murder of George Floyd, racism, and police brutality also took place, notably in the cities of Accra, Athens, Auckland, Barcelona, Berlin, Brisbane, Cape Town, Copenhagen, Dublin, Lagos, Madrid, Melbourne, Nairobi, Paris, Perth, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Vienna, as well as in the countries of Canada and the United Kingdom. Protests occurred in over 60 countries and on all continents, including Antarctica.[better source needed][a] The protests resulted in police reforms being proposed on the federal level in the United States and in jurisdictions in over 20 states.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_Square,George Floyd Square,George Floyd,"George Floyd Square, officially George Perry Floyd Square in Minneapolis, is a commemorative name applied to Chicago Avenue between the East 37th and 39th Streets in the Powderhorn neighborhood. George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered there by police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. The name addition, approved in 2022, is indicated by supplementary signs; businesses along the two blocks retain their Chicago Avenue addresses. Public outrage over Floyd's murder resulted in one of the largest mass protest movement since the 1960s civil rights movement, largely over issues of systemic racism and police brutality. In the following weeks, racial justice activists and some community members erected barricades to keep the East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue intersection closed to vehicular traffic for over a year after Floyd's murder. Artists and demonstrators installed several exhibits, paintings, sculptures, and other works of art to memorialize Floyd and visualize racial justice themes. The City of Minneapolis has been planning a permanent memorial to Floyd at the site. Chicago Avenue is a major north–south thoroughfare in Minneapolis. It was named Ames Street in an 1855 city plat map. Sometime in the late 1880s, the Minneapolis City Council changed the name of Ames Street to Chicago Avenue, but historians are unsure exactly when or why the street was renamed. Chicago Avenue intersects East 38th Street in the city's Powderhorn community. The 38th and Chicago street intersection is a border for several city neighborhoods: Bancroft, Bryant, Central, and Powderhorn Park. The East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue intersection was the location of the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, an officer with the Minneapolis Police Department. Chauvin, a White man, knelt on the neck of Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for about 9 minutes and 29 seconds while Floyd begged for help, said he could not breathe, lost consciousness, and died on May 25, 2020. The incident, which occurred in the street outside the Cup Foods store, was filmed by bystanders and circulated widely in the media. In reaction to Floyd's murder, protests began locally on May 26, 2020, and gave way to local and nationwide movements. After several days, the Black Lives Matter movement protests spread throughout the United States and to many other countries.","African-American history in Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Geography of Hennepin County, Minnesota | Memorials to George Floyd | Monuments and memorials in Minnesota | Neighborhoods in Minneapolis | Streets in Minneapolis | 2022 establishments in Minnesota","2022, 1855, 2020","Geography | History | Murder of George Floyd | ""Autonomous"" zone | Official designation and planning | Visitors | Other features | Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center",Former name(s): George Perry Floyd Jr. Place | Part of: Powderhorn community | Namesake: George Floyd | Type: Commemorative street | Owner: City of Minneapolis,2343,2025-06-22 19:32:41
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Minneapolis–Saint_Paul,George Floyd protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul,George Floyd protests 2020,"Local protests over the murder of George Floyd, sometimes called the Minneapolis riots or the Minneapolis uprising, began on May 26, 2020, and within a few days had inspired a global protest movement against police brutality and racial inequality. The initial events were a reaction to a video filmed the day before and circulated widely in the media of police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes while Floyd struggled to breathe, begged for help, lost consciousness, and died. Public outrage over the content of the video gave way to widespread civil disorder in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and other cities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area over the five-day period of May 26 to 30 after Floyd's murder. Minneapolis sustained extensive damage from rioting and looting during the protests—largely concentrated on a 5-mile (8.0 km) stretch of Lake Street south of downtown—including the destruction of the city's 3rd police precinct building, which was overrun by demonstrators and set on fire. At cost of $350 million, approximately 1,300 properties in Minneapolis were damaged by the civil unrest, of which nearly 100 were entirely destroyed. Saint Paul suffered damages that totaled $82 million and affected 330 buildings, including 37 properties that were heavily damaged or destroyed, with most destruction along the University Avenue business corridor. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tracked 164 structure fires due to arson in the Twin Cities region during the riots. Governor Tim Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard in response to civil unrest. The 7,123 troops activated represented the largest deployment of the state's forces since World War II. By early June 2020, violence in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area had resulted in at least two deaths, 604 arrests, and more than $500 million in damage to approximately 1,500 properties, the second-most destructive period of local unrest in U.S. history, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Violent protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul over Floyd's murder largely subsided after May 30, 2020. The Minnesota National Guard and a multi-jurisdiction government command that responded to the riots demobilized on June 7, 2020. Local protests and unrest over Floyd's murder continued in 2020–2023 and broadened to other issues of racial injustice.

According to Ari Weil, a terrorism researcher, there were 104 incidents of vehicles driving into protests between May 27 and September 27, 2020, with two fatalities in that time period. According to law enforcement and terrorism experts some of the incidents were targeted and politically motivated, however the vast majority were incidents involving scared drivers who were surrounded by protesters in their vehicle.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_the_United_Kingdom,George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom,George Floyd protests 2020,"Protests were held across the United Kingdom following the murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, by a police officer in the United States on 25 May 2020. Immediately following his murder, protests and riots occurred in dozens of cities across the United States. Protests were staged internationally for the first time on 28 May, with a solidarity demonstration outside the United States Embassy in London. They took place during the UK COVID-19 pandemic. Large protests were held across the United Kingdom, particularly in Birmingham, Liverpool, London, Manchester, and Newcastle. Many protests were organised by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Stand Up to Racism movements. As well as providing solidarity to protests in the United States, many of the ongoing protests in the United Kingdom highlighted issues with racism faced from law enforcement in the United Kingdom and in daily life. Many protests received endorsement and support from local councils and politicians,[who?] including in Liverpool and Oxford. The majority of protests in the United Kingdom were peaceful, although notable clashes between protesters and police occurred on multiple occasions in central London. There were also notable cases of vandalism of historical statues, including graffiti sprayed on the plinth of the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston from its pedestal and then pushed it into the harbour on 7 June. Subsequently, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan established the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm in order to investigate whether statues on display in London were still suitable for the modern-day. The George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom were the largest outside the United States. The protests took place at a time in the COVID-19 pandemic during which there were restrictions on public gatherings. As measured by COVID-19 death toll, the United Kingdom was at the time the third-worst affected country globally. During the period of the protests in May and June, public gatherings were legally limited to a maximum of six people, all separated by 2 metres (6.6 ft), although police forces tolerated the majority of protests despite the restrictions outlawing them. Many protests attempted to follow social distancing, and some handed out masks and gloves to attendees, although there were still concerns that the protests could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 ",George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom | COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom | George Floyd protests by country | May 2020 in the United Kingdom | June 2020 in the United Kingdom | Police brutality in the United Kingdom | Protest marches in the United Kingdom | Premiership of Boris Johnson,2020,Overview | Timeline of protests | May | June | Impact and effects | Actions against memorials | Renaming of places | Reaction,"Date: 28 May 2020 – 21 June 2020(3 weeks and 3 days) | Location: United Kingdom | Caused by: Reaction to the murder of George Floyd in the United States

Most are in the Southern United States and were founded during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877) following the American Civil War. Their original purpose was to provide education for African Americans in an era when most colleges and universities in the United States did not allow Black students to enroll. During the Reconstruction era, most historically Black colleges were founded by Protestant religious organizations. This changed in 1890 with the U.S. Congress' passage of the Second Morrill Act, which required segregated Southern states to provide African Americans with public higher education schools in order to receive the Act's benefits. During the 19th century, either after expanding their inclusion of Black people and African Americans into their institutions or gaining the status of minority-serving institution, became predominantly Black institutions (PBIs). For a century after the abolition of American slavery in 1865, almost all colleges and universities in the Southern United States prohibited all African Americans from attending as required by Jim Crow laws in the South, while institutions in other parts of the country regularly employed quotas to limit admission of Black people. HBCUs were established to provide more opportunities to African Americans and are largely responsible for establishing and expanding the African-American middle class. In the 1950s and 1960s, legally enforced racial segregation in education was generally outlawed throughout the South (and anywhere else in the United States), and other non-discrimination policies were adopted. There are 101 HBCUs[needs update] in the United States (of 121 institutions that existed during the 1930s), representing three percent (3%) of the nation's colleges, including public and private institutions. 27 offer doctoral programs, 52 offer master's programs, 83 offer bachelor's degree programs, and 38 offer associate degrees. HBCUs currently produce nearly 20% of all African American college graduates and 25% of African American STEM graduates. Among the graduates of HBCUs are civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., United States Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, American film director Spike Lee, former United States vice president Kamala Harris and the late Ameri",Historically black universities and colleges in the United States | African Americans and education | Universities and colleges in the United States by subject,"1964, 1877, 1865, 1890",History | Private institutions | Public institutions | Predominantly Black institutions | Sports | Jewish refugees | World War II | Florida's Black junior colleges,,2536,2025-06-22 19:41:39

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBCU_band,HBCU band,HBCU historically black colleges,"A Historically Black College and University marching band (also known as a HBCU band) is the marching band sponsored by a historically black college or university. A distinctive ""HBCU-style"" of marching band originated in the American South in the 1940s through the blending of earlier traditions of military music and minstrel shows with a performance repertoire based on popular song.[citation needed] HBCU bands have traditionally played a major role in fostering school pride and camaraderie. Different studies have linked HBCU band membership with both higher and lower rates of academic achievement versus the at-large student population.[citation needed] Among the predominantly male, African-American membership of the ensembles, they have been theorized to support positive identity formation. Early American military music recruited large numbers of black musicians. A 1738 statute enacted by the Virginia House of Burgesses required military service for “free mulattos, blacks, and Native Americans"". Due to government concerns of a domestic rebellion, they were prohibited from carrying arms and were, therefore, exclusively used as ""drummers, fifers, trumpeters, or pioneers”. As many as 5,000 African-Americans provided military service during the American War of Independence, including notable musicians such as Barzillai Lew. The tendency to recruit African-Americans into military bands continued after independence; following the War of 1812, a large number of civilian, all-black brass bands formed among veteran military musicians across the United States, but particularly in New Orleans where they often adopted the theatrical styles of minstrel shows. Drawing on these traditions, the first HBCU band was established in 1890 at Tuskegee Normal School (later Tuskegee University) under student direction. In 1907 its first professional director, retired U.S. Army Major Nathaniel Clark Smith, was appointed. Ensembles at additional historically black colleges and universities followed. Under the early direction of W.C. Hardy - a former minstrel show musician - Alabama A&M University began performing popular songs of the day in addition to marches, an approach to music selection later popularized among other HBCU and Primarily White Institution (PWI) bands. The earliest incarnation of the modern HBCU style of marching band, in which the distinctive high-stepping style coalesced with popular music and elaborate dance routines by both bandsmen and auxiliaries, has been ",Marching bands | Sports and historically black universities and colleges in the United States | African-American culture,"1890, 1738, 1812, 1907, 1952",History | Origins | Early history | 21st century | Characteristics | Drum majors | Instrumentation | Marching style and drill technique,,2741,2025-06-22 19:41:41
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ivy_League,Black Ivy League,HBCU historically black colleges,"The Black Ivy League refers to a segment of the historically black colleges (HBCUs) in the United States that attract the majority of high-performing or affluent black students. The actual Ivy League is an eight-member athletic conference, however, Black Ivy schools are neither organized as an official group nor affiliated with the NCAA Ivy League sports conference. At one point in history, some of these institutions debated forming a Black Ivy League athletic conference, but did not reach an agreement. Similar other terms include: Public Ivies, Southern Ivies, and the Little Ivies among others, none of which have canonical definitions. Generally, the institutions themselves avoid using the term Black Ivy to describe themselves. There is no agreement as to which schools are included in the ""Black Ivy League"", and sources list different possible members. The 1984 book Blacks in Colleges by Jacqueline Fleming states that the schools that make up the Black Ivy league are (in no particular order): Fleming further notes that ""[t]he presence of Black Ivy League colleges pull the best and most privileged black students...

The epicenter was near the town of Léogâne, Ouest department, approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The earthquake is the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century for a single country. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. Haiti's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster. The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, Hédi Annabi. Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called ""Hope for Haiti Now"", raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies.

Some countries arranged to send relief and rescue workers and humanitarian supplies directly to the earthquake damage zones, while others sought to organize national fund raising to provide monetary support for the nonprofit groups working directly in Haiti. OCHA coordinates and tracks this on a daily basis. The information is disseminated through the UN news and information portal, ReliefWeb. As of September 5, 2013, ReliefWeb have reported a total relief funding of $3.5 billion given (and a further $1 billion pledged but not given). The United States was by far the largest single contributor to the relief efforts. The international community also committed numerous major assets such as field hospitals, naval vessels, a hospital ship, aircraft carriers, transport aircraft and emergency facilities soon after the extent of the disaster became apparent. The Dominican Republic was the first country to mobilize resources to aid and rescue Haiti immediately after the earthquake. Progress in responding to the earthquake was hampered by a number of factors, including loss of life, a number of aftershocks, destroyed infrastructures, collapsed buildings blocking streets, the lack of electricity for gasoline station pumps, loss of the capital's seaport, and loss of air traffic control facilities. The damage to the Haitian government ministries, all of which suffered varying degrees of destruction and personnel deaths, impeded coordination of the disaster response. In April 2010, the Haitian government asked that food distribution in the Pétion-Ville camp cease in order to allow the normal economy to resume.",International responses to natural disasters | 2010 in international relations | 2010 Haiti earthquake relief | 2010 Haiti earthquake,"2010, 2013",Appeals for aid | Response by national governments | Response by intergovernmental organizations | Organization of American States | Union of South American Nations | United Nations | Response by non-governmental organizations | Response by corporations,,1838,2025-06-22 19:33:58

A number of public figures died in the earthquake, including government officials, clergy members, musicians, together with foreign civilian and military personnel working with the United Nations. On 15 January, the Red Cross estimated the death toll at between 45,000 and 50,000, however by 24 January, Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said the death toll was over 150,000 in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area alone. Haitian president René Préval reported on 27 January that ""nearly 170,000"" bodies had been counted. On 21 February, Preval raised that estimate to 300,000. In February, prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive estimated that 300,000 had been injured. Speaking in Miami in June 2010, Bellerive also estimated the number of deaths had been 300,000. On the first anniversary of the quake, Bellerive raised the death toll to 316,000. He said that was, in part, because of the recovery of additional bodies. A University of Michigan study in 2010 estimated about 160,000 deaths.

The declaration marked Haiti becoming the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, only the second in the Americas after the United States. Notably, the Haitian declaration of independence signalled the culmination of the only successful slave revolution in history. Only two copies of the original printed version exist. Both of these were discovered by Julia Gaffield, a Duke University postgraduate student, in the UK National Archives in 2010 and 2011. They are currently held by The National Archives, Kew. The declaration itself is a three-part document. The longest section, ""Le Général en Chef Au Peuple d’Hayti"", which is known as the ""proclamation,"" functions as a prologue. It has one signatory, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the senior general and a former slave. Due to Dessalines being illiterate and unable to speak French, his secretary Louis Boisrond-Tonnerre then read out the proclamation, followed by the act of independence, which were both written by the latter. This declaration was later followed by an independence day speech from Dessalines—recited in Haitian Creole—in which he denounced France. In particular, the declaration demands vengeance against the French White Creoles, who committed atrocities against the African-Haitian population. Dessalines claimed that: ""It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; … We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government ….

In 1791, the enslaved Africans of Saint-Domingue began the Haitian Revolution, aimed at the overthrow of the colonial reign. For more than one thousand years, Arawak and Taino people inhabited what was later known as Hispaniola. The name Haiti (or Hayti) comes from the indigenous Taíno language and was the native name given to the entire island of Hispaniola to mean ""land of high mountains."" Christopher Columbus arrived on the island on December 5, 1492 and claimed it for the Spanish Empire, after which it became known as Hispaniola. Later, under French colonial rule, the Caribbean island was known as Saint-Domingue (French pronunciation: [sɛ̃.dɔ.mɛ̃ɡ]) and was a French colony from 1659 to 1804. Early on, enslaved people on the island began resisting captivity and fighting to restore their freedom. Examples of this resistance include the uprising of Padrejean in 1676 and the uprising of François Mackandal in 1757. The French Revolution began in 1789. On June 21st, 1791, King Louis XVI and his family attempted to flee Paris, but the plan failed due to a series of misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and poor judgments. Louis was officially arrested on August 13th, 1792, and sent to the Temple, an ancient fortress in Paris used as a prison. On September 21st, the National Assembly declared France to be a republic, and abolished the monarchy. Louis was stripped of all his titles and honors, and from then on was known as Citoyen Louis Capet. News of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen reached Hispaniola's inhabitants and inspired them to reclaim their rights. On the night of August 14th, 1791, representatives of people enslaved on local plantations gathered in the woods near Le Cap to participate in a secret ceremony.

Haiti was controlled by France before declaring independence on 1 January 1804. The Governor-General of Haiti, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, created the empire on 22 September 1804. After being proclaimed emperor by the Generals of the Haitian Revolution Army, he held his coronation ceremony on 6 October and took the name Jacques I. The constitution of 20 May 1805 set out the way the empire was to be governed, with the country split into six military divisions. The general of each division corresponded directly with the emperor or the general in chief appointed by the emperor. The constitution also set out the succession to the throne, with the crown being elective and the reigning emperor having the power to appoint his successor. The constitution also banned white people, with the exception of naturalised Germans and Poles, from owning property inside the empire. Jacques I was assassinated on 17 October 1806. Two members of his administration, Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe, then assumed power, which led to a split in the country – with Pétion leading the southern Republic of Haiti and Christophe leading the northern State of Haiti (later Kingdom of Haiti). Some 43 years later, on 26 August 1849, President Faustin Soulouque re-established an Empire in Haiti that lasted until 15 January 1859. Fearing the return of the French to the island, Dessalines and Henri Christophe built forts to fend them off. On October 8, 1804, he was crowned Emperor under the name of Jacques I of Haiti, in Cap-Haïtien under the title His Majesty Jacques I, Emperor.",1800s in Haiti | 1804 establishments in Haiti | Former countries in the Caribbean | Former empires in North America | States and territories established in 1804 | States and territories disestablished in 1806 | Former empires,"1804, 1805, 1859, 1849, 1806",History | See also | References | External links,Capital: Port-au-Prince | Official languages: French | Common languages: Haitian Creole,1737,2025-06-22 19:33:39
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Haiti),Independence Day (Haiti),Haiti independence 1804,"Independence Day in Haiti is celebrated annually as a public holiday on every 1st of January along with New Years Day, commemorating the nation's liberation from the French Empire. It also marks the birth of the world's first independent black republic, one achieved through an unprecedented successful slave revolt with the Haitian Revolution. On January 1, 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines proclaimed Haiti's independence from the French in the port city of Gonaïves, ending the 12 year-long war against the bondage imposed upon the people by the French planters. This date is also special as the island, previously called Saint-Domingue, obtained a new name - Haiti - meaning ""Land of the mountains"" in Taino-Arawak. In honor of Independence Day, nationwide celebrations and festivities are held with additional special tributes such as renditions of the anthem and firework shows paying respect to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, hailed as the hero of the revolution. Additionally, military parades are held in the nation's capital city of Port-au-Prince that are accompanied by cultural showcases with public figures also delivering speeches on Haiti and its future. Central to the celebrations is the tradition of eating Joumou soup, a symbolic dish cherished by Haitians as a symbol of equality and freedom due to the fact the French had forbidden the enslaved to consume it during colonial rule. Upon independence, Haitians embraced the soup, making it take on new meanings of defiance and liberation. Since then, its consumption has been enshrined as a declaration that French rule is a thing of the past in Haiti. The Haitian Declaration of Independence, a key document in the history of Haiti, was given along with an Independence Day speech by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The document was not written by Dessalines himself though, instead relying on his secretary, Louis Boisrond-Tonnerre, to transcribe his spoken words due to his inability to speak or write in French. Divided into three sections, the most substantive of the declaration itself is the prologue, titled ""Le Général en Chef Au Peuple d’Hayti,"" which translates to ""The Chief General to the People of Haiti.""",Public holidays in Haiti | Independence days | January observances,1804,Haitian Declaration of Independence | References,,2173,2025-06-22 19:33:40

It is also the most widely spoken creole language in the world. Northern, Central, and Southern dialects are the three main dialects of Haitian Creole. The Northern dialect is predominantly spoken in Cap-Haïtien, Central is spoken in Port-au-Prince, and Southern in the Cayes area. The language emerged from contact between French settlers and enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) in the 17th and 18th centuries. Although its vocabulary largely derives from 18th-century French, its grammar is that of a West African Volta-Congo language branch, particularly the Fongbe and Igbo languages. It also has influences from Spanish, English, Portuguese, Taíno, and other West African languages. It is not mutually intelligible with standard French, and it also has its own distinctive grammar. Some estimate that Haitians are the largest community in the world to speak a modern creole language, others estimate that more people speak Nigerian Pidgin. Haitian Creole's use in communities and schools has been contentious since at least the 19th century. Some Haitians view French as inextricably linked to the legacy of colonialism and language compelled on the population by conquerors, while Creole has been maligned by francophones as a miseducated person's French. Until the late 20th century, Haitian presidents spoke only standard French to their fellow citizens, and until the 21st century, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in modern standard French, a second language to most of their students. Haitian Creole is also spoken in regions that have received migration from Haiti, including other Caribbean islands, French Guiana, Martinique, France, Canada (particularly Quebec) and the United States (including the U.S. state of Louisiana). It is related to Antillean Creole, spoken in the Lesser Antilles, and to other French-based creole languages.",Haitian Creole | French-based pidgins and creoles | Languages of Haiti | Languages of the Bahamas | Languages of Costa Rica | Languages of Cuba | Languages of the Dominican Republic | Languages of the United States,,Etymology | Origins | Saint-Domingue Creole French | Difference between Haitian Creole and French | Taino influence | History | Early development | Becoming an official language,"Pronunciation: [kɣejɔl ajisjɛ̃] | Native to: Haiti | Ethnicity: Haitians | Native speakers: 13 million (2020)[1] | Language family: French Creole[2]

Haitian culture and French and Haitian Creole languages, first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially Guantanamo, where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in Baracoa and Maisí, the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Due to the United States occupation of Haiti, many Haitians left to find work as laborers in neighboring countries like Cuba. These immigrants lived a fine line trying to maintain their Haitian culture and assimilating enough to be able to work and live in a foreign society. In 1937, over 25,000 Haitians were forcibly removed from Cuba and sent back to Haiti. This different treatment of migrant laborers is due to several factors. Cuban racists beliefs combined with economic concerns were a direct catalyst for this drastic Haitian exodus. Cubans feared a repeat of the Haitian Revolution, which was not quelled by the current guerrilla warfare in Haiti by the caco forces against the Americans. Similarly, black Haitians were stereotyped as being violent and rife with crime.

Haitian French is close to standard French. It should be distinguished from Haitian Creole, which is not mutually intelligible with French. The phoneme consonant /ʁ/ is pronounced [ɣ], but it is often silent in the syllable coda when occurring before a consonant or prosodic break (faire is pronounced [fɛː]). The nasal vowels are not pronounced as in Metropolitan French: /ɑ̃/ → [ã], /ɛ̃/ → [ɛ̃], /ɔ̃/ → [õ], and /œ̃/ → [œ̃]. The typical vowel shifts make it sound very much like other regional accents of the French Caribbean and the Francophone countries of Africa. The perceivable difference between Haitian French and the French spoken in Paris lies in the Haitian speaker's intonation, where a subtle creole-based tone carrying the French on top is found. Importantly, these differences are not enough to create a misunderstanding between a native Parisian speaker and a speaker of Haitian French. In Haiti, the French spoken in Paris is very influential, so much so that a growing number of Haitians would rather speak it as precisely as possible and pursue this by listening to Radio France Internationale and matching the somewhat conservative style of speech heard on that station. In the educated groups, French is spoken more closely to the Parisian accent. It is within this group that a major portion of enrollment is provided for the private schools and universities.

The revolution was the only known slave uprising in human history that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery (though not from forced labour) and ruled by non-whites and former captives. The revolt began on 22 August 1791, and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence. It involved black, biracial, French, Spanish, British, and Polish participants—with the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture emerging as Haiti's most prominent general. The successful revolution was a defining moment in the history of the Atlantic World and the revolution's effects on the institution of slavery were felt throughout the Americas. The end of French rule and the abolition of slavery in the former colony was followed by a successful defense of the freedoms the former slaves had won, and with the collaboration of already free people of color, of their independence from white Europeans. The revolution was the largest slave uprising since Spartacus' unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1,900 years earlier, and challenged long-held European beliefs about alleged black inferiority and about slaves' ability to achieve and maintain their own freedom.

The 1791 revolt of enslaved individuals in Saint-Domingue was the largest and most successful slave rebellion in modern history. In spite of their various important roles in the Haitian Revolution, women revolutionaries have rarely been included within historical and literary narratives of the slave revolts. However, in recent years extensive academic research has been dedicated to their part in the revolution. In the French colony of Saint-Domingue, enslaved Black women suffered particular forms of gendered violence in addition to the standard abuse and mistreatment of slaves. Rape and sexual abuse of enslaved women commonly occurred in the colony; part of the logic of slavery was that since slaves were property, they could be used as sex objects by slave owners. Due to high infant mortality and a low fertility rate, slave women were kept from engaging in monogamous family relationships and instead treated as objects of reproduction. Many of these women resorted to suicide. The Haitian Revolution was instigated by slaves in an attempt to not only liberate themselves but to remove the French from the island entirely. Rebels used a variety of tactics to meet this goal; women participated in all levels of the revolt. As laborers, enslaved women began to organize and refuse to perform life-threatening work. In one such case, women who worked the night shift in a sugarcane mill protested working with machinery in the dark that could seriously injure or kill them.",Haitian revolutionaries | Haitian women | Women in 18th-century warfare | Women in 19th-century warfare | Women in the Haitian Revolution,"1791, 1804",Women in pre-revolutionary Saint-Domingue | Women's roles in the revolution | Labor organising | Vodou | Combat | French women | Punishments for Haitian women | Sexual assault,,1655,2025-06-22 19:33:33

The Haitian Revolution defeated the French army in November 1803 and the Haitian Declaration of Independence happened on 1 January 1804. From February 1804 until 22 April 1804, between 3,000 and 7,000 people were killed. The massacre excluded surviving Polish Legionnaires, who had defected from the French legion to become allied with the enslaved Africans, as well as the Germans who did not take part of the slave trade, and some other select whites. They were instead granted full citizenship under the constitution, even though Dessalines had declared that all Haitians would be considered ""black"". Nicholas Robins, Adam Jones, and Dirk Moses theorize that the executions were a ""subaltern genocide"", in which an oppressed group uses genocidal means to destroy its oppressors. Philippe Girard has suggested the threat of reinvasion and reinstatement of slavery as some of the reasons for the massacre. Throughout the early-to-mid nineteenth century, the events of the massacre were well known in the United States. Additionally, many Saint Dominican refugees moved from Saint-Domingue to the U.S., settling in New Orleans, Charleston, New York, Baltimore, and other coastal cities.

The revolt was notable for being one of the only slave rebellions in history to succeed and for its prominence in the history of Haiti.

The period is noted for the change from absolutist monarchies to representative governments with a written constitution, and the creation of nation states. Influenced by the new ideas of the Enlightenment, the American Revolution (1765–1783) is usually considered the starting point of the Age of Revolution. It in turn inspired the French Revolution of 1789, which rapidly spread to the rest of Europe through its wars. In 1799, Napoleon took power in France and continued the French Revolutionary Wars by conquering most of continental Europe. Although Napoleon imposed on his conquests several modern concepts such as equality before the law, or a civil code, his rigorous military occupation triggered national rebellions, notably in Spain and Germany. After Napoleon's defeat, European great powers forged the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15, in an attempt to prevent future revolutions, and also restored the previous monarchies. Nevertheless, Spain was considerably weakened by the Napoleonic Wars and could not control its American colonies, almost all of which proclaimed their independence between 1810 and 1820. Revolution then spread back to southern Europe in 1820, with uprisings in Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Continental Europe was shaken by two similar revolutionary waves in 1830 and 1848, also called the Spring of Nations. The democratic demands of the revolutionaries often merged with independence or national unification movements, such as in Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc. The violent repression of the Spring of Nations marked the end of the era. The expression was popularized by the British historian Eric Hobsbawm in his book The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848, published in 1962. The Atlantic Revolutions (19 April 1775 – 4 December 1838) were numerous revolutions in the Atlantic World in the late 18th and early 19th century, which formed a significant portion of the Age of Revolution. Following the Age of Enlightenment, ideas critical of absolutist monarchies spread. A revolutionary wave occurred, with the aim of ending monarchical rule, emphasizing the ideals of the Enlightenment, and spreading liberalism.",Age of Revolution | Napoleonic Wars | 18th-century revolutions | 19th-century revolutions | Historical eras | History of Europe | History of North America | History of South America,"1783, 1814, 1799, 1765, 1848, 1830, 1810, 1789, 1820",Atlantic Revolutions | History | National revolutions | Europe | Americas | Important individuals during the revolutions | Important organizations or movements during the revolutions | Industrial Revolution,"Date: 22 March 1765 – 4 October 1849 | Outcome: Industrial RevolutionMultiple revolutionary wavesAtlantic RevolutionsLatin American wars of independenceRevolutions of 1820Revolutions of 1830Revolutions of 1848End of feudalismRise of Republicanism | Deaths: American Revolution: 37,324+[1]

Among many white Americans, this led to uneasiness, instilling fears of racial instability on its own soil and possible problems with foreign relations and trade between the two countries. Among enslaved black Americans, it fueled hope that the principles of the recent American Revolution might be realized in their own liberation. While the Haitian Revolution was occurring during the presidencies of George Washington and John Adams, members of the Federalist Party, including Alexander Hamilton, supported Toussaint Louverture and his revolution. Adams appointed Edward Stevens as U.S. consul-general to Haiti to forge a closer relationship between the two nations and express US support for Louverture's government. Hamilton urged Louverture to adopt an autocratic military dictatorship with hereditary rule, as he believed ex-slaves were incapable of democratic government. Hamilton advocated for closer diplomatic and economic relations between Haiti and the United States, but warned against formal diplomatic recognition. The U.S. started to become less diplomatic to Haiti under the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson recognized that the revolution had the potential to cause an upheaval against slavery in the US not only by slaves, but by white abolitionists as well. Southern slaveholders feared the revolt might spread from the island of Hispaniola to their own plantations. Against this background and with the declared primary goal of maintaining social order in Haiti, the US, refused acknowledgement of Haitian independence until 1862. The US also embargoed trade with the nascent state. American merchants had conducted a substantial trade with the plantations on Hispaniola throughout the 18th century, the French-ruled territory providing nearly all of its sugar and coffee. However, once the Haitian slave population emancipated itself, the US was reluctant to continue trade for fear of upsetting the evicted French on one hand and its Southern slaveholders on the other. Despite this, there were anti-slavery advocates in northern cities who believed that consistency with the principles of the American Revolution — life, liberty and equality for all — demanded that the U.S. support the Haitian people. One outcome of the Haitian Revolution for the United States of America was the Louisiana Purchase.

The western portion of the island of Hispaniola, where Haiti is situated, was inhabited by the Taíno and Arawakan people, who called their island Ayiti. The island was promptly claimed for the Spanish Crown, where it was named La Isla Española (""the Spanish Island""), later Latinized to Hispaniola. By the early 17th century, the French had built a settlement on the west of Hispaniola and called it Saint-Domingue. Prior to the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the economy of Saint-Domingue gradually expanded, with sugar and, later, coffee becoming important export crops. After the war which had disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In 1767, it exported indigo, cotton and 72 million pounds of raw sugar. By the end of the century, the colony encompassed a third of the entire Atlantic slave trade. In 1791, slaves staged a revolt which led to the Haitian Revolution. André Rigaud, leader of the revolution, forced the French to withdraw. When Toussaint Louverture declared independence in 1802, Napoleon sent an invasion force to coerce the Haitians. After the death of Toussaint while in imprisonment by the French, the Generals Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Henri Christophe, and Alexandre Pétion laid heavy battle against Charles Leclerc, the leader of the French invasion. As the tide of the war turned in favor of the Haitians, Napoleon abandoned the invasion, which led to Dessalines declaring the independence of Haiti in 1804. Dessalines orchestrated a massacre of the remaining French population in Haiti, resulting in over 5,000 deaths. Men, women, and children were killed as revenge for Napoleon's invasion. Whites were hanged from gallows along the coast, signaling to passing ships that Haiti had purged itself of Europeans. Soon after independence, Haiti was proclaimed an empire under Dessalines. When Dessalines was murdered, Haiti then divided off into two regions, controlled by rival regimes, with Christophe ruling the semi-feudal northern State of Haiti and Pétion ruling the more tolerant southern Republic of Haiti.

There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Vodouists, Vodouisants, or Serviteurs. Vodou teaches the existence of a transcendent creator divinity, Bondye, under whom are spirits known as lwa. Typically deriving their names and attributes from traditional West and Central African deities, they are equated with Catholic saints. The lwa divide into different groups, the nanchon (""nations""), most notably the Rada and the Petwo, about whom various myths and stories are told. This theology has been labelled both monotheistic and polytheistic. An initiatory tradition, Vodouists commonly venerate the lwa at an ounfò (temple), run by an oungan (priest) or manbo (priestess). Alternatively, Vodou is also practised within family groups or in secret societies like the Bizango. A central ritual involves practitioners drumming, singing, and dancing to encourage a lwa to possess one of their members and thus communicate with them. Offerings to the lwa, and to spirits of the dead, include fruit, liquor, and sacrificed animals. Several forms of divination are utilized to decipher messages from the lwa. Healing rituals and the preparation of herbal remedies and talismans also play a prominent role. Vodou developed among Afro-Haitian communities amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. Its structure arose from the blending of the traditional religions of those enslaved West and Central Africans brought to the island of Hispaniola, among them Kongo, Fon, and Yoruba. There, it absorbed influences from the culture of the French colonialists who controlled the colony of Saint-Domingue, most notably Roman Catholicism but also Freemasonry. Many Vodouists were involved in the Haitian Revolution of 1791 to 1801 which overthrew the French colonial government, abolished slavery, and transformed Saint-Domingue into the republic of Haiti. The Catholic Church left for several decades following the Revolution, allowing Vodou to become Haiti's dominant religion. In the 20th century, growing emigration spread Vodou abroad. The late 20th century saw growing links between Vodou and related traditions in West Africa and the Americas, such as Cuban Santería a",Haitian Vodou | Afro-Caribbean religion | Afro-Haitian culture | Afro-American religion | Christianity and religious syncretism | Folk Catholicism | Religion in Haiti,"1791, 1801","Definitions and terminology | Terminology | Beliefs | Bondye and the lwa | Soul and afterlife | Morality, ethics, and gender roles | Practices | Oungan and Manbo",,3125,2025-06-22 19:33:53
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_mythology,Haitian mythology,Haitian Vodou culture,"Haitian mythology consists of many folklore stories from different time periods, involving sacred dance and deities, all the way to Vodou. Haitian Vodou is a syncretic mixture of Roman Catholic rituals developed during the French colonial period, based on traditional African beliefs, with roots in Dahomey, Kongo and Yoruba traditions, and folkloric influence from the indigenous Taino peoples of Haiti. The lwa, or spirits with whom Vodou adherents work and practice, are not gods but servants of the Supreme Creator Bondye (pronounced Bon Dieu). A lot of the Iwa identities come from deities formed in the West African traditional regions, especially the Fon and Yoruba.[citation needed] In keeping with the French-Catholic influence of the faith, Vodou practioneers are for the most part monotheists, believing that the lwa are great and powerful forces in the world with whom humans interact and vice versa, resulting in a symbiotic relationship intended to bring both humans and the lwa back to Bondye. ""Vodou is a religious practice, a faith that points toward an intimate knowledge of God, and offers its practitioners a means to come into communion with the Divine, through an ever evolving paradigm of dance, song and prayers."" Vodou originated from the Animist beliefs of the Yoruba tribes in Benin. Voudon encapsulates an assortment of cultural elements, including personal creeds and practices, among which is a complex system of folk medical practices. Voudon to some is more than a belief but a way of life, upon which popular proverbs, stories, songs, and folklore are based around. Voudon teaches belief in a supreme being called Bondye, an unknowable and uninvolved created god. Voudon believers worship the lwa. There are in total 180 lwa in the Vodou religion, each of them carrying a name and, a specific and exclusive function. For instance, Gede are the spirit of life and death who is assigned to separate the souls and bodies of people when the time comes and also to watch over their graveyards. Gede also serve the role of connecting the past, present, and future, as well as amalgamating them into one reality. Mythology in Haiti was used not only for politics but also for the revolution. Myths like: L'Union Fait La Force (Togetherness is Strength), is a story about slaves who rose up on August 22, 1791, in a heroic battle to win their freedom, and is a story about solidarity between two different groups of people to get freedom for the collective.

Vodou drumming is widely practiced in urban centres in Haiti and some cities in North America (especially New Orleans). The ritualistic faith system that involves ceremonies that consist of singing, drumming and dancing. The Vodou drumming rituals call upon abstract ancestral spirits, called Loas (or Lwas), for their aid, instruction, special powers and strengths as embodiment of certain principles or characteristics. While certain aspects of this religion may share the same roots, it is completely contrary to the stereotype of black magic, witch doctors, pins in dolls, and zombies portrayed by New Orleans style Voodoo (a variation of the name). Through the involuntary mass dispersion of slavery, the traditional West African Vodun religions went through the process of Religious syncretism between Roman Catholicism. Due to mass dispersion of the West African population from its indigenous territories, the colonial plantation system created and influenced the Haitian Vodou's ecotheological perspective. The relationship of Vodou's belief system lies heavily on ecological systems. The interest in ecotheological ethics are the base of beliefs in Vodou religion, these ethics are ancestor worship, nature spirits, and natural processes such as birth, death, weather, and fertility. With the globalization of Yoruba religions through African diaspora, many Eurocentric religions denounce Yoruba religions and practices. This is because of the negative misconception where it is believed that religions like Haitian Vodou, have a devotion to witchcraft, sorcery, and demon worship. The demonization of Yoruba religions can be contributed to the blatant racism caused by colonization. In April 2003 Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide officially recognized Vodou as a religion in Haiti. Due to the negative stigma that surrounds the Haitian Vodou, The Haitian government has had a history of previously persecuting those who practiced the religion. Vodou in Haiti was often used as a scapegoat for the country’s issues. This misunderstanding and negative stigma can be noted back to the nation's founding.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manbo_(Vodou),Manbo (Vodou),Haitian Vodou culture,"A manbo (also written as mambo) is a priestess (as opposed to a oungan, a male priest) in the Haitian Vodou religion. Haitian Vodou's conceptions of priesthood stem from the religious traditions of enslaved people from Dahomey, in what is today Benin. For instance, the term manbo derives from the Fon word nanbo (""mother of magic""). Like their West African counterparts, Haitian manbos are female leaders in Vodou temples who perform healing work and guide others during complex rituals. This form of female leadership is prevalent in urban centers such as Port-au-Prince (the capital of Haiti). Typically, there is no hierarchy among manbos and oungans. These priestesses and priests serve as the heads of autonomous religious groups and exert their authority over the devotees or spiritual servants in their hounfo (temples). Manbos and oungans are called into power via spirit possession or the revelations in a dream. They become qualified after completing several initiation rituals and technical training exercises where they learn the Vodou spirits by their names, attributes, and symbols. The first step in initiation is lave tèt (head washing), which is aimed at the spirits housed in an individual's head. The second step is known as kouche (to lie down), which is when the initiate enters a period of seclusion. Typically, the final step is the possession of the ason (sacred rattle), which enables the manbos or oungans to begin their work. One of the main goals of Vodou initiation ceremonies is to strengthen the manbo's konesans (knowledge), which determines priestly power. The specific skills and knowledge gained by manbos enable them to mediate between the physical and spiritual realms. They use this information to call upon the spirits through song, dance, prayer, offerings, and/or the drawing of vèvès (spiritual symbols). During these rituals, manbos may either be possessed by a loa (also spelled lwa, Vodou spirits) themselves, or may oversee the possession of other devotees. Spirit possession plays an important role in Vodou because it establishes a connection between human beings and the Vodou deities or spirits. Although loas can ""mount"" whomever they choose, those outside the Vodou priesthood do not have the skills to communicate directly with the spirits or gods. This is because the human body is merely flesh, which the spirits can borrow to reveal themselves via possession. manbos, however, can speak to and hear from the Vodou spirits.

However, in West African countries with major conservative Christian and Islamic views on LGBTQ people, the attitudes towards them may be less tolerant if not openly hostile and these influences are reflected in African diaspora religions following Atlantic slave trade which includes Haitian Vodou. Haitian Vodou itself has remained open to people of all sexual orientations. It is common knowledge in Haiti that a significant number of Haitian Vodou are gay. Many LGBT people in Haiti believe that it is easier to be open about one's sexuality and gender expression within Vodou culture, in the face of open hostility by mainstream Haitian society. Vodou is an ancestral religion, and viewed by some Western anthropologists as an ecstatic religion. It is not a fertility-based religion [citation needed] (see Fertility rites). This means that the majority of its members are not required by any religious law to reproduce, and homosexuals are not pressured to do so.[citation needed] Haitian Vodou views sexual orientation as a part of the way God makes a person; homosexuals are free to pursue members of the same sex just as heterosexuals are free to pursue members of the opposite sex. In Haitian Vodou, male homosexuals are seen as under the protection of the Erzulie Freda, the loa of love and beauty. She is very feminine, allowing gay men to exhibit stereotypical traits during religious ceremonies. The documentary ""Des hommes et dieux"" presents interviews with several people who feel Erzulie Freda made them gay. Erzulie Dantor is seen as the patron of lesbians, although she is herself bisexual[citation needed] having a number of children and two husbands, Simbi Makaya and Ti Jean Petwo, though she is said to prefer the company of women.",LGBTQ in Haiti | Religion and LGBTQ people | LGBTQ topics in the African diaspora | Haitian Vodou,,Haitian views of homosexuality | Opposing views in non-Haitian based Vodou | Relationship between loa and gender identity | Beliefs | See also | References | Sources | Further reading,,1882,2025-06-22 19:33:56

It is an important expression of Haitian culture and history. Many artists cluster in ""schools"" of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by ""Vaudou"" symbolism. The Centre d'Art is an art center, school and gallery located in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was founded in 1944 by American watercolorist DeWitt Peters and several prominent Haitians from the intellectual and cultural circles including: Maurice Borno, Andrée Malebranche, Albert Mangonès, Lucien Price, and Georges Remponeau. Popular artists of this movement often were influenced by vaudou and include: André Pierre, Hector Hippolyte, Castera Bazile, Wilson Bigaud and Rigaud Benoit. Haitian art is a type of artwork often characterized by vivid colors, spatial composition and spontaneity of painting. By the mid 1950s, Haitian naïve art was firmly established, and other institutions began to emerge, such as the Foyer des Arts Plastiques (1950) and the Galerie Brochette (1956).",Haitian art,"1950, 1956, 1944",Painting | Centre d’Art | Saint Soleil School | Artibonite artists | Diaspora outside of Haiti | Market painting | Sculpture | Haitian flag-making,,1329,2025-06-22 19:34:06
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada,Dada,Haitian art movement,"Dada (/ˈdɑːdɑː/) or Dadaism was an anti-establishment art movement that developed in 1915 in the context of the Great War and the earlier anti-art movement. Early centers for dadaism included Zürich and Berlin. Within a few years, the movement had spread to New York City and a variety of artistic centers in Europe and Asia. Within the umbrella of the movement, people used a wide variety of artistic forms to protest the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalism and modern war. To develop their protest, artists tended to make use of nonsense, irrationality, and an anti-bourgeois sensibility. The art of the movement began primarily as performance art, but eventually spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism and maintained political affinities with radical politics on the left-wing and far-left politics. The movement had no shared artistic style, although most artists had shown interest in the machine aesthetic. There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife randomly into a dictionary, where it landed on ""dada"", a French term for a hobby horse. Others note it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate it might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism. The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian Futurists, and German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the correlation between words and meaning. Works such as Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916–17) by Erik Satie would be characterized as proto-Dadaist works. The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916. Ball is seen as the founder of the Dada movement. The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art and literary journals.

The Haitian people have their origins in West and Central Africa with the most spoken language being the French based Haitian Creole. The larger Haitian diaspora includes individuals that trace ancestry to Haiti and self-identify as Haitian but are not necessarily Haitian by citizenship. The United States and the Dominican Republic have the largest Haitian populations in the world after Haiti. An ethno-national group, Haitians generally comprise the modern descendants of self-liberated Africans in the Caribbean territory historically referred to as Saint-Domingue.

The structural issues of the country, in combination with patriarchal views that dominate the culture, bar Haitian women’s ability to experience full autonomy in the eyes of the state. These trends have been consistent throughout the history of the country irrespective to times of peace or political unrest. Some Haitian scholars argue that Haitian peasant women are often less restricted socially than women in Western societies or even in comparison to more westernized elite Haitian women. Compared to their Latin-American counterparts, the participation of Haitian women in agriculture, commerce and industry has been high. During the US occupation of Haiti (1915-1934) peasant women actively participated in guerilla warfare and anti-US intelligence gathering to free the country.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance,Harlem Renaissance,Harlem Renaissance 1920s,"The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual and cultural revival of African-American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theater, politics, and scholarship centered in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, spanning the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after The New Negro, a 1925 anthology edited by Alain Locke. The movement also included the new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeastern United States and the Midwestern United States affected by a renewed militancy in the general struggle for civil rights, combined with the Great Migration of African-American workers fleeing the racist conditions of the Jim Crow Deep South, as Harlem was the final destination of the largest number of those who migrated north. Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood, many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris, France, were also influenced by the movement. Harlem had also seen significant Black immigration from British, French and other colonies in the Caribbean. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, took place between 1924—when Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance—and 1929, the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African-American arts, and many of it ideas and forms influenced society and thought in the following decades. Until the end of the Civil War, the majority of African Americans had been enslaved and lived in the South. During the Reconstruction Era, the emancipated African Americans began to strive for civic participation, political equality, and economic and cultural self-determination. Soon after the end of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 gave rise to speeches by African-American congressmen addressing this bill. By 1875, sixteen African Americans had been elected and served in Congress and gave numerous speeches with their newfound civil empowerment. The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was followed by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, part of Reconstruction legislation by Republicans.

Before colonization, there were many flourishing traditions of Native American art, and where the Spanish colonized Spanish Colonial architecture and the accompanying styles in other media were quickly in place. Early colonial art on the East Coast initially relied on artists from Europe, with John White (1540-c. 1593) the earliest example. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, artists primarily painted portraits, and some landscapes in a style based mainly on English painting. Furniture-makers imitating English styles and similar craftsmen were also established in the major cities, but in the English colonies, locally made pottery remained resolutely utilitarian until the 19th century, with fancy products imported. But in the later 18th century two U.S. artists, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, became the most successful painters in London of history painting, then regarded as the highest form of art, giving the first sign of an emerging force in Western art. American artists who remained at home became increasingly skilled, although there was little awareness of them in Europe. In the early 19th century the infrastructure to train artists began to be established, and from 1820 the Hudson River School began to produce Romantic landscape painting that were original and matched the huge scale of U.S. landscapes. The American Revolution produced a demand for patriotic art, especially history painting, while other artists recorded the frontier country. A parallel development taking shape in rural U.S. was the American craft movement, which began as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. After 1850 Academic art in the European style flourished, and as richer Americans became very wealthy, the flow of European art, new and old, to the US began; this has continued ever since. Museums began to be opened to display much of this. Developments in modern art in Europe came to the U.S. from exhibitions in New York City such as the Armory Show in 1913. After World War II, New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world. Since then many U.S. movements have shaped Modern and Postmodern art. Art in the United States today covers a huge range of styles.

Initially, the Rens played mostly in Harlem, but Douglas soon realized they could book more games on the road, in larger-capacity venues, and took up barnstorming across the country for more lucrative payouts. The Renaissance are also the topic of the 2011 documentary On the Shoulders of Giants. The Rens were one of the dominant basketball teams of the 1920s and 1930s. They were originally known as the Spartan Braves, the basketball team of the Spartan Field Club, a Manhattan-based multi-sport amateur athletic organization whose initial focus was cricket. The Rens played their first game on November 3, 1923, winning against the Collegiate Five, an all-white team. Interracial games featured regularly on their schedule, drawing the largest crowds. In its first years, the team strove to beat the Original Celtics, the dominant white team of the time, and claim the title of world champions. In their fifth encounter, the Rens did so for the first time, on December 20, 1925, winning 37 to 30. During the 1932–33 regular season, the Rens compiled a record of 120–8 (six of those losses came at the hands of the Celtics, whom the Rens did beat eight times). During that season, the Rens won 88 consecutive games, a mark that has never been matched by a professional basketball team. In 1939, the Rens won the first professional basketball championship, when they beat the Oshkosh All-Stars, a white team, 34–25, in the World Professional Basketball Tournament in Chicago. The team compiled a 2,588–529 record from 1923 to 1948. Important players on the Rens roster included Clarence ""Fats"" Jenkins, Pappy Ricks, Eyre Saitch, Bill Yancey, ""Wee"" Willie Smith, Charles ""Tarzan"" Cooper, Zack Clayton, John Isaacs, Dolly King, Pop Gates, and Nat Clifton.

March 1822 – March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist and social activist. After escaping slavery, Tubman made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including her family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known collectively as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women's suffrage. Born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by enslavers as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate overseer threw a heavy metal weight, intending to hit another slave, but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. After her injury, Tubman began experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God. These experiences, combined with her Methodist upbringing, led her to become devoutly religious. In 1849, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, only to return to Maryland to rescue her family soon after. Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other enslaved people to freedom. Tubman (or ""Moses"", as she was called) travelled by night and in extreme secrecy, and later said she ""never lost a passenger"". After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, she helped guide escapees farther north into British North America (Canada), and helped newly freed people find work. Tubman met John Brown in 1858, and helped him plan and recruit supporters for his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry. When the Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. For her guidance of the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 enslaved people, she is widely credited as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the United States. After the war, she retired to the family home on property she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She was active in the women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and was admitted to a home for elderly African Americans, which she had helped establish years earlier. Tubman is commonly viewed as an icon of courage and freedom.",Harriet Tubman | 1822 births | 1913 deaths | 19th-century African-American people | 19th-century African-American women | 19th-century American slaves | 19th-century Christian mystics | 19th-century Methodists,"1822, 1850, 1849, 1859, 1913, 1858","Birth and family | Childhood | Family and first husband | Escape from slavery | Nicknamed ""Moses"" | Routes and methods | John Brown and Harpers Ferry | Auburn and Margaret","Born: Araminta Rossc. March 1822[1]Dorchester County, Maryland, U.S. | Died: March 10, 1913 (aged 90–91)Auburn, New York, U.S. | Resting place: Fort Hill Cemetery, Auburn, New York, U.S.42°55′29″N 76°34′30″W﻿ / ﻿42.9246°N 76.5750°W﻿ / 42.9246; -76.5750 | Other names: MintyMoses | Occupations: Civil War scoutspynursesuffragistcivil rights activist | Known for: Guiding enslaved people to freedom",2453,2025-06-22 19:38:24
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman's_family,Harriet Tubman's family,Harriet Tubman,"Harriet Tubman (1822–1913) was an American abolitionist and political activist. Tubman escaped slavery and rescued approximately 70 enslaved people, including members of her family and friends. Harriet Tubman's family includes her birth family, her two husbands, John Tubman and Nelson Davis, and her adopted daughter, Gertie Davis. Tubman's parents—Benjamin ""Ben"" Ross and Harriett ""Rita"" Gene Ross—were enslaved by two different families. Their lives came together when Mary Pattison Broadness, Rita's enslave, married Anthony Thompson. Ben Ross, enslaved by Thompson, met and married Rit Greene. They lived together until about 1823 or 1824 when Rit and their children went to the Brodess farm. Ben was a timber estimator and foreman, and Rit was a domestic servant. After Ben was freed, he bought his wife's freedom. Ben was a conductor on the Underground Railroad, and enslavers became suspicious of his role in escapes in the area. Tubman, having freed other family members, rescued her parents. After a short period in St. Catharines in Ontario, Canada, Tubman and her parents settled in the Auburn, New York area. Tubman married a free man, John Tubman, in 1844. In 1849, Tubman fled the area, believing she would be sold. She returned to the area to bring John Tubman north, but he had already married another woman. Tubman operated a boarding house out of her home in Auburn, and Nelson Davis boarded with her for three years before they were married in 1869. Davis fought during the American Civil War. They adopted a girl, Gertie, and operated several businesses out of their farm. They raised pigs and chickens, operating a farm selling eggs and butter. Tubman made 13 trips to Maryland to bring back her brothers, parents, other family members, friends, and others. Tubman did not know of the whereabouts of her sisters, except Rachel, who was separated from her children and died before the family could be reunited. She did not have any biological children. Family members of enslaved people were often spread out over a distance. Sometimes, it was because they were sold to other enslavers; in other cases, because their enslaver had multiple properties and rotated enslaved people across several residences. Sometimes, enslaved people were hired out for work. Enslavers also enslaved the children of enslaved women. In the case of Harriet Tubman's family members, enslavers changed their lives at will. Their enslavers were the white Brodess, Pattison, Stewart, and Thompson familie","Harriet Tubman | People from Dorchester County, Maryland","1822, 1824, 1823, 1849, 1844, 1913, 1869",Background | Ben and Rit Greene Ross | Ben | Rit | Freedom in New York | Siblings and other family members | Marriages | John Tubman,,2535,2025-06-22 19:38:25

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa–Fulani,Hausa–Fulani,Hausa Fulani history,"Hausa–Fulani are people of mixed Hausa and Fulani origin. [dead link]They are primarily found in the Northern region of Nigeria, most of whom speak a variant of Hausa or Fula or both as their first language. The term Hausa-Fulani is also used mostly as a joint term to refer to both the monoethnic Hausa and Fulani ethnic populations in Northern Nigeria. While some Fulani claim Semitic origins, Hausas are indigenous to West Africa. This suggests that the processes of ""Hausaization"" in the western Sudan region was probably both cultural and genetic. The Hausa–Fulani identity came into being as a direct result of the migration of Fulani people to Hausaland around the 14th century and their cultural assimilation into the Hausa society. At the beginning of the 19th century, Sheikh Usman dan Fodio led a successful jihad against the Hausa Kingdoms founding a centralized Fulani Empire (anglicized as the Sokoto Caliphate). After the jihad, Dan Fodio encouraged intermarriage between the immigrant Fulani and the conquered Hausa states and locals mainly other Hausa people; in addition, Jobawa, Dambazawa and Sullubawa Fulani clans originating in Futa Tooro migrated to the region and intermarried with the local urban mainly Hausa elite, and were a major factor in the linguistic, cultural and ethnic mixing of the Hausa–Fulani people. As result of this assimilation, Hausa–Fulani form the core and vast majority of the populations of Daura, Zamfara, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, and Sokoto. Hausa–Fulanis primarily speak variants of Hausa which form a dialect continuum of more-or-less mutually intelligible regional varieties. Hausa is spoken by over 100 to 150 million people across Africa, making it the most spoken Indigenous African language and the 11th most spoken language in the world. Since the Trans-Saharan trade, Hausa is used as a lingua franca spanning from Agadez deep in the Sahara Desert of Niger to Northern Nigeria, and has many loanwords from Arabic. For centuries, it utilized an Ajami script which served as the basis of the language scholarly tradition. The script was replaced with the Latin orthography of the Boko alphabets, after the British conquered the Sokoto Caliphate. Medieval Arabic sources refers to the area as Sudan or as Bilad Al Sudan (English: Land of the Blacks; Arabic: بلاد السودان). This designation may have given rise to the term Negroland which was used by Europeans until the 19th century to refer to the inner poorly explored area north of the region ",Ethnic groups in Nigeria | Ethnic groups in Niger | Muslim communities in Africa | Muslim ethnoreligious groups in Africa | Nigeria stubs | African ethnic group stubs | Niger stubs | Afroasiatic peoples,,Historical perspective | See also | References,,3348,2025-06-22 19:35:55
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_Kingdoms,Hausa Kingdoms,Hausa Fulani history,"Hausa Kingdoms, also known as Hausa Kingdom or Hausaland, was a collection of states ruled by the Hausa people, before the Fulani jihads. It was situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad (modern day northern Nigeria). Hausaland lay between the Western Sudanic kingdoms of Ancient Ghana, Mali and Songhai and the Eastern Sudanic kingdoms of Kanem-Bornu. Hausaland took shape as a political and cultural region during the first millennium CE as a result of the westward expansion of Hausa peoples. They arrived in Hausaland when the terrain was converting from woodlands to savannah. They started cultivating grains, which led to a denser peasant population. They had a common language, laws and customs. The Hausa were known for fishing, hunting, agriculture, salt-mining, and blacksmithing. By the 14th century, Katsina had become the most powerful city-state. Katsina was the base for the trans-Saharan trade in salt, cloth, leather, and grain. The Hausa oral history is reflected in the Bayajidda legend, which describes the adventures of the Baghdadi hero, Bayajidda, culminating in the killing of the snake in a well at Daura and the marriage with the local queen Magajiya Daurama. According to the legend, the hero had a child with the queen, Bawo, and another child with the queen's maid-servant, Karbagari. Though the 7 Hausa states shared the same lineage, language and culture, the states were characterized by fierce rivalries with each other with each state seeking supremacy over the others. They constantly waged war on each other and would often work with invaders to the detriment of their sister states, hindering their collective strength. According to the Bayajidda legend, Hausa states were founded by the sons and grandsons of Bayajidda, a prince whose origin differs by tradition, but official canon records him as the person who married Daurama, the last Kabara of Daura, and heralded the end of the matriarchal monarchs that had erstwhile ruled the Hausa people. According to the most famous version of the story, the story of the Hausa states started with a prince from Baghdad called ""Abu Yazid"". When he got to Daura, he went to the house of an old woman and asked her to give him water but she told him the predicament of the land, how the only well in Daura, called Kusugu, was inhabited by a snake called Sarki, who allowed citizens of Daura to fetch water only on Fridays.

They speak the Hausa language, which is the second most spoken language after Arabic in the Afro-Asiatic language family. The Hausa are a culturally homogeneous people based primarily in the Sahelian and the sparse savanna areas of southern Niger and northern Nigeria respectively, numbering around 86 million people, with significant populations in Benin, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Chad, the Central African Republic, Togo, and Ghana, as well as smaller populations in Sudan, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea,[citation needed] Gabon, Senegal, and Gambia. Predominantly Hausa-speaking communities are scattered throughout West Africa and on the traditional Hajj route north and east traversing the Sahara, with an especially large population in and around the town of Agadez. Other Hausa have also moved to large coastal cities in the region such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Accra, Abidjan, Banjul and Cotonou as well as to parts of North Africa such as Libya over the course of the last 500 years. The Hausa traditionally live in small villages as well as in precolonial towns and cities where they grow crops, raise livestock including cattle as well as engage in trade, both local and long distance across Africa. They speak the Hausa language, an Afro-Asiatic language of the Chadic group. The Hausa aristocracy had historically developed an equestrian based culture. Still a status symbol of the traditional nobility in Hausa society, the horse still features in the Eid day celebrations, known as Ranar Sallah (in English: the Day of the Prayer). Daura is the cultural center of the Hausa people. The town predates all the other major Hausa towns in tradition and culture. The Hausa have, in the last 500 years, criss-crossed the vast landscape of Africa in all its four corners for varieties of reasons ranging from military service, long-distance trade, hunting, performance of hajj, fleeing from oppressive Hausa feudal kings as well as spreading Islam. Because the vast majority of Hausas and Hausa speakers are Muslims, many attempted to embark on the Hajj pilgrimage, a requirement of all Muslims who are able. On the way to or back from the Hijaz region, many settled, often indigenizing to some degree. For example, many Hausa in Saudi Arabia identify as both Hausa and Afro-Arab.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad_of_Usman_dan_Fodio,Jihad of Usman dan Fodio,Hausa Fulani history,"Sokoto victory The Jihad of Usman dan Fodio was a religio-military conflict in present-day Nigeria and Cameroon. The war began when Usman dan Fodio, a prominent Islamic scholar and teacher, was exiled from Gobir by King Yunfa, one of his former students. Usman dan Fodio assembled an Islamic army to lead a jihad against Gobir and other Hausa Kingdoms of northern Nigeria. The forces of Usman dan Fodio slowly took over more and more of the Hausa kingdoms, capturing Gobir in 1808 and executing Yunfa. The war resulted in the creation of the Sokoto Caliphate, initially headed by Usman dan Fodio himself, which became one of the largest states in Africa in the 19th century. His success inspired similar jihads in Western Africa. The ancient Kanem–Bornu Empire was losing power by the mid-18th century. There was large-scale immigration by Fulani pastoralists, leading to resource competition with more settled Hausa communities despite their shared religion. Several Hausa kingdoms previously tributary to Kanem-Bornu became independent and fought with each other. Rulers enforced harsh systems of conscription and taxation, while war caused social disruption, economic hardship, and enslavement of war captives. Fulani communities felt especially victimized by Hausa rulers' taxation and land control. Two prominent Hausa kingdoms that were central in the Jihad were Gobir, where Usman dan Fodio's parents settled in his childhood and where he lived until 1804, and Zamfara. Usman dan Fodio, born in 1754, joined a growing number of traveling Islamic scholars through the Hausa kingdoms in the 1770s and became quite popular in the 1790s. Much of his preaching focused on the obligations of Muslim rulers to promote Islam and to rule ethically and generously in a manner that allowed their subjects to live as good Muslims while criticizing corruption, hypocrisy, oppression of fellow Muslims, and tolerance of beliefs and practices in conflict with Islam. Originally, dan Fodio's preaching received the support of the leadership of Gobir; however, as his influence increased and as he began to advocate for self-defense arming by his followers, his favor with the leadership decreased. King Nafata of Gobir, placed a series of restrictions on preaching by dan Fodio's followers and by Usman himself. In 1801, Sarkin Gobir Yunfa, a former pupil of dan Fodio, replaced Nafata as king and increased the restrictions on dan Fodio, exiling him from Gobir to the village of Degel.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_people,Fula people,Hausa Fulani history,"The Fula, Fulani, or Fulɓe people[a] are an ethnic group in Sahara, Sahel and West Africa, widely dispersed across the region. Inhabiting many countries, they live mainly in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa, South Sudan, Darfur, and regions near the Red Sea coast in Sudan. The approximate number of Fula people is unknown, due to clashing definitions regarding Fula ethnicity. Various estimates put the figure between 25 and 40 million people worldwide. A significant proportion of the Fula – a third, or an estimated 7 to 10 million – are pastoralists, and their ethnic group has the largest nomadic pastoral community in the world. The majority of the Fula ethnic group consisted of semi-sedentary people, as well as sedentary settled farmers, scholars, artisans, merchants, and nobility. As an ethnic group, they are bound together by the Fula language, their history and their culture. The Fula are almost completely Muslims with a small minority being Christians and Animists. Many West African leaders are of Fulani descent, including the former President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari; the first president of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo; the former President of Senegal, Macky Sall; the President of Gambia, Adama Barrow; the President of Guinea-Bissau, Umaro Sissoco Embaló; the prime minister of Guinea, Bah Oury; and the Prime Minister of Mali, Boubou Cissé. They also occupy positions in major international institutions, such as the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina J. Mohammed; the 74th President of the United Nations General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande; and the Secretary-General of OPEC, Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo. There are many names (and spellings of the names) used in other languages to refer to the Fulɓe. Fulani in English is borrowed from the Hausa term. Fula, from the Manding languages, is also used in English, and sometimes spelled Fulah or Fullah. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the Wolof term Pël, which is variously spelled: Peul, Peulh, and even Peuhl. More recently the Fulfulde / Pulaar term Fulɓe, which is a plural noun (singular, Pullo) has been Anglicised as Fulbe, which is gaining popularity in use.

Born in the British Caribbean, Christophe was possibly of Senegambian descent. Beginning with the slave uprising of 1791, he rose to power in the ranks of the Haitian revolutionary military. The revolution succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1805 he took part under Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the capture of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the Treaty of Basel. After Dessalines was assassinated, Christophe retreated to the Plaine-du-Nord and created a separate government. On 17 February 1807, he was elected president of the State of Haiti, as he named that area. Alexandre Pétion was elected president of the Republic of Haiti in the south. On 26 March 1811, Christophe created a kingdom in the north and was later proclaimed Henry I, King of Haïti. He also created a nobility and named his legitimate son Jacques-Victor Henry as prince and heir. He is known for constructing Citadel Henry, now known as Citadelle Laferrière, the Sans-Souci Palace, the royal chapel of Milot, the Palais de la Belle Rivière and numerous other palaces. Under his policies of corvée, or forced labor bordering on slavery, the Kingdom earned revenues from agricultural production, primarily sugar, but the Haitian people resented the system. He reached an agreement with the United Kingdom to respect its Caribbean colonies in exchange for their warnings to his government of any French naval activity threatening Haiti. In 1820, unpopular, ill and fearing a coup, he committed suicide. Jacques-Victor, his son and heir, was assassinated 10 days later.

It was created on 17 October 1806 following the assassination of Emperor Jacques I and the overthrow of the First Empire of Haiti. The northern State of Haiti was ruled by Henri Christophe originally as Provisional Chief of the Haitian Government from 17 October 1806 until 17 February 1807 when he became President of the State of Haiti. The 1807 constitution for the State of Haiti made the post of president a position for life with the president having the power to appoint his successor. On 28 March 1811 President Henri was proclaimed King Henri I, thereby dissolving the State of Haiti and creating the Kingdom of Haiti. Following the assassination of Emperor Jacques I, the country was split. Parallel with the government of Christophe in the north, Alexandre Pétion, a free person of color, ruled over the south of the country as President of the Republic of Haiti until his death in 1818. He was succeeded by Jean-Pierre Boyer, who reunited the two parts of the nation after the deaths of Henri I and Henri I's son, Jacques-Victor Henry, in 1820. From 1791 to 1804, the Haitian revolution against the French colonists raged. After the failure of the French expedition of 1803, General Jean-Jacques Dessalines proclaimed Haiti's independence.

This was Haiti's second attempt at monarchical rule, as Jean-Jacques Dessalines had previously ruled over the First Empire of Haiti as Emperor Jacques I from 1804 until his assassination in 1806.

Because he was both born and died before his father's ascension as King, in 1811, he was never Prince Royal of Haiti, nor was he ever heir apparent to the throne. He was born in 1794 in Cap-Français (Le Cap), Saint-Domingue, now known as Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, as the first child and eldest son of Henri Christophe, a Field General and former slave, and Marie-Louise Coidavid, the daughter of a black hotel owner. Although not yet royalty, Christophe had big plans for his son and wanted him to follow in his footsteps. In a conversation with a friend, Christophe once proudly said of his infant son: ""Never have I seen a finer baby than my little Francois-Ferdinand. He is strong and strapping, like me. He recognized me. He caught hold of my finger and smiled. He is the image of me!"" When he was the appropriate age, Christophe started making plans for François-Ferdinand's education. He wanted his son to be a military man, like he was. As a young boy, François-Ferdinand was sent by his father to France, more specifically to Paris, where Christophe hoped that his son would receive a sturdy, military education. Instead, the Parisians, freshly defeated by the Haitian armies led by Christophe, in numerous battles, took François-Ferdinand out of school and made him a hostage. Christophe, learning of this situation, demanded explanations.[citation needed] The French promised that his son would receive a liberal education; instead, they placed François-Ferdinand in an orphans' asylum in Paris. On October 7, 1805, the 11-year-old boy died at the Orphans' Hospital of Paris. Both the circumstances of his death and his burial place are unknown.[citation needed] Even after Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti, he remained heartbroken because of his son's death.

Elements of American hip hop culture, such as graffiti art and breakdancing, diffused into Western Europe in the early 1980s. Early underground artists included Cora E. and Advanced Chemistry. It was not until the early 1990s that German hip hop entered the mainstream as groups like Die Fantastischen Vier and the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt gained popularity. German hip hop was heavily influenced by films, leading to a strong emphasis on visual and cultural elements such as graffiti and breakdancing beyond the music itself. In addition to films, such as Wild Style and Beat Street, American expats and soldiers stationed in Germany facilitated the introduction of hip hop music and culture into German pop culture. GLS United released the first German language hip hop song, Rapper's Deutsch, in 1980. While the group (consisting of three radio DJs including the later comedian and TV host Thomas Gottschalk) was formed explicitly for the one song, and the song was intended primarily as a parody of Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang, it was none-the-less the first German hip hop group and first German-language hip hop track. Also the punk rock band Die Toten Hosen released one of the first German hip hop songs, Hip Hop Bommi Bop, in 1983, which also was one of the first rap rock crossovers ever.

Many Korean hip-hop songs contain syllabic similarities that could be interpreted in either languages. The bilingual aspect of this music is one distinguishing factor between Korean hip-hop and American hip-hop. As early-stage Korean hip-hop was heavily influenced by African-American hip-hop, Korean hip-hop artists began using AAVE in their lyrics. The dominance of Korean-Americans in the Korean hip-hop scene also contributed to the use of mixed languages in Korean hip-hop.

It is characterized by the key elements of rapping,[b] DJing and turntablism, and breakdancing; other elements include graffiti, beatboxing, street entrepreneurship, hip hop language, and hip-hop fashion. Many cite Hip Hop's emergence as beginning in August 1973 when brother–sister duo DJ Kool Herc and Cindy Campbell hosted the first documented indoor hip hop party and culture event in the Bronx; Helping to spark the rise of the genre. However many hiphop pioneers and historians contend that Hip Hop did not have just one founding father. The black Spades street gang and Disco king Mario of the Bronxdale Houses are also considered a vital part in the early origins of Hip Hop culture and music. As Disco King Mario was hosting and organizing outdoor Hip Hop Culture events, and park jams that predated DJ Kool Herc's 1973 indoor Hip Hop party. Dj Kool Herc was among the attendees at those early Disco King Mario Hip Hop events. Since then Hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip-hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats, and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called ""flipping"" in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted and Latino musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, salsa, and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide.

The term has also come to be used as an alternative for rap music and even pop music which involves rappers of South Asian origins. The launch of Bohemia's second album Pesa Nasha Pyar (2006), whose tracks such as ""Kali Denali"", ""Kurti"" and ""Sahara"" became big hits, generated a new-found interest in rap songs performed in desi languages during the early 2000s. Even though there were several occasional hits during this period, the desi hip hop scene remained limited largely to the underground, with a very niche loyal audience. Hip-hop culture, including graffiti and b-boying started seeping into the club scene and street culture of big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Also, 2017 saw a major boost in this genre through the start of Rap battle culture introduced by an entertainment and music production house named 6FU. Rap battles being a culture of western countries, saw India inheriting it and witnessing its first rap battle in regional languages through 6FU's first event Frontline that was held in Delhi. The label started its YouTube channel in 2017 and has since given underground rappers a new hope to be heard and establish rap as a career. Started by Trouble, who hosts rap battles and cypher (freestyling) sessions, 6FU started seeing an influx of more than a dozen rappers who perform turn-by-turn on the same stage to see who has the better verses. Desi hip hop has crossed paths with Western hip-hop multiple times, notably when musicians from both sides of the world collaborate. American rapper Snoop Dogg has worked with different artists such as rapper Dr Zeus, Bohemia, and the band RDB. Bohemia also collaborated with hip-hop artists such as Kurupt, Sean Kingston, Iraj Weeraratne and Baby Bash & The Game.

The term has also come to be used as an alternative for rap music and even pop music which involves rappers of South Asian origins. It is widely known today as Desi Hip Hop or DHH. Indian hip hop emerged in the mid-1980s, driven by American breakdancing films such as Wild Style (1982) and Beat Street (1984), gaining popularity in urban youth culture in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, and Kolkata. By the late 1980s, Kolkata became a centre for hip hop dance workshops, while Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai prioritised rap, leading to emergence of distinct regional hip hop scenes in local languages by the late 1990s. Apache Indian, a UK artist of Indian origin, was the earliest to make an impact on the UK charts with a series of hits during the 90s. This also paralleled the rise of Asian Underground in the UK. The inflow of hip hop into India is also attributed to certain clubs and DJs in New Delhi in the 90s. Baba Sehgal introduced a caricaturist version of Hindi rap in the 1990s with his albums. In 1992, his album Thanda Thanda Pani sold 100,000 copies in three and a half months and brought rap music to the Indian club scene. Yo Yo Honey Singh transformed, popularized hip-hop and rap into the mainstream Indian audience, beginning with the release of the track Glassy in 2006 with Ashok Masti which featured an English rap by Singh while also the music being produced by Singh.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop_soul,Hip-hop soul,Hip hop culture origins,"Hip hop soul is a subgenre of contemporary R&B music, most popular during the early and mid 1990s, which fuses R&B or soul singing with hip hop musical production. The subgenre had evolved from a previous R&B subgenre, new jack swing, which had incorporated hip-hop influences into R&B music. By contrast, hip hop soul is, as described in The Encyclopedia of African American Music, ""quite literally soul singing over hip hop grooves"". The genre was most popular during the mid and late 1990s with artists such as Mary J. Blige (known as the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul""), Jodeci, Faith Evans, TLC, and R. Kelly. By the late 1990s, hip hop soul would lead to the creation of neo soul, which retained the hip hop and R&B influences while also adding elements of classic 1970s soul music. Hip hop soul evolved directly from new jack swing, a form of contemporary R&B popularized by artists and producers such as Teddy Riley and his group Guy, Keith Sweat, and Bobby Brown. New jack swing had incorporated elements of hip-hop music—primarily hip-hop-inspired drum tracks and rapped verses—into contemporary R&B music also heavily inspired by the work of Prince. Hip hop soul shifted from new jack swing's reliance on synth-heavy production and took the hip-hop/R&B synthesis further by having R&B singers sing directly over the types of sample-heavy backing tracks typically found in contemporary hip-hop recordings like boom bap. The creation and evolution of hip hop soul led to an increasingly symbiotic relationship between its parent genres. Hip hop soul acts presented themselves in styles and personas comparable to those of rappers—dressing in hip-hop fashions and adopting a tougher image than the traditional pop-friendly personas of R&B artists (the existence and popularity of hip hop soul also had the opposite effect on mainstream rappers, who took on some of the elements of the R&B artists' personas to become more palatable to mainstream audiences). The subgenre increased the popularity of R&B music among the younger hip-hop audience, leading to better sales and airplay success for hip hop soul recordings versus previous forms of post-disco R&B, on the Billboard pop music sales charts. It also increased the popularity of hip-hop music and culture with older audiences and corporations looking to market urban music. However, the creation of hip hop soul has been argued by music journalists and fans of R&B music to have ""killed off"" traditional styles of R&B.",American styles of music | Contemporary R&B genres | Hip-hop genres | Soul music genres,,Description | History | See also | References,"Stylistic origins: Hip hopsoulR&Bnew jack swing | Cultural origins: Early 1990s, U.S. | Derivative forms: Neo soul",2475,2025-06-22 19:33:00
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_hip-hop,French hip-hop,Hip hop culture origins,"French hip hop or French rap (French: rap français, [ʁap fʁɑ̃sɛ]), is the hip hop music style developed in French-speaking countries. France is the second largest hip-hop market in the world after the United States. By 1982 and 1983, a number of hip hop radio shows had appeared on Paris radio, including ""Rapper Dapper"" (hosted by Sidney Duteil) and ""Funk à Billy"" (hosted by DJ Dee Nasty). In November 1982 the New York City Rap Tour traveled around France and to London featuring Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DST, Fab 5 Freddy, Mr Freeze and the Rock Steady Crew. The first major star of French hip hop was MC Solaar. Born Claude M'Barali in Dakar, Senegal, he moved as a child to France in 1970 and lived in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. His 1991 album, Qui sème le vent récolte le tempo, was a major hit. The European Music Office's report on Music in Europe said that the French language was well-suited for rapping. He set many records, including being the first French hip hop recording artist to go platinum. Some artists claim that the French language hip hop style was influenced by the music of French singer Renaud. Following MC Solaar's breakthrough, two broad styles emerged within the French hip hop scene; artists such as Solaar, Dee Nasty, and Lionel D championed a more mellow, sanguine style, while more hardcore performers such as Assassin and Suprême NTM assumed a more aggressive aesthetic. Many such artists found themselves at the heart of controversies over lyrics that were seen as glorifying the murder of police officers and other crimes, similar to outcries over violent thuggish lyrics in American gangsta rap. The cases include the notorious Ministère AMER's ""Sacrifice de poulet"", NTM's ""Police"" and later Lunatic's ""Le crime paie"".",French hip-hop | French styles of music,"1983, 1991, 1970, 1982",History | Beginning of French hip hop: the 70s and 80s | Influence of American hip-hop | The 1990s and 2000s | Themes | Relationship with Africa and the Caribbean | French Antilles hip hop | Language,,1761,2025-06-22 19:33:01

Their primary origin is found in modern-day Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo States, while others can be found in the Niger Delta and along the Cross River. The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa. The Igbo language is part of the Niger-Congo language family. Its regional dialects are mutually intelligible amidst the larger ""Igboid"" cluster. The Igbo homeland straddles the lower Niger River, east and south of the Edoid and Idomoid groups, and west of the Ibibioid (Cross River) cluster. Before the period of British colonial rule in the 20th century, the Igbo people were largely governed by the centralized chiefdoms of Nri, Aro Confederacy, Agbor, Kingdom of Aboh and Onitsha. The Igbo people became overwhelmingly Christian during the evangelism of the missionaries in the colonial era in the twentieth century. In the wake of decolonisation, the Igbo developed a strong sense of ethnic identity. Christianity and Omenala/Odinala are the major religions, with Islamic minorities. After ethnic tensions following the independence of Nigeria in 1960, the Igbos seceded from Nigeria and attempted to establish a new independent country called Biafra, triggering the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970). Millions of Biafran civilians died from starvation after the Nigerian military formed a blockade around Biafra, an event that led to international media promoting humanitarian aid for Biafra. Biafra was eventually defeated by Nigeria and reintegrated into the country. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), two organizations formed after 1999, continue to struggle for an independent Igbo state.",Igbo people | Ethnic groups in Nigeria | Indigenous peoples of the Niger Delta | West African people | Biafra | Igbo society,"1967, 1999, 1970, 1960",Definition and subgroups | Etymology | History | Prehistory | Kingdom of Nri | Igbo-Ukwu archaeology | Aro Confederacy | Aro-Ibibio Wars,"Nigeria: 35,088,096 (15.2% of total population)[2] | United States: 117,000[3]",1936,2025-06-22 19:35:50

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people_in_Jamaica,Igbo people in Jamaica,Igbo people history,"Igbo people in Jamaica were trafficked by Europeans onto the island between the 18th and 19th centuries as enslaved labour on plantations. Igbo people constituted a large portion of the African population enslaved people in Jamaica. Jamaica received the largest number of enslaved people from the biafra region than anywhere else in the diaspora during the slave trade. Some slave censuses detailed the large number of enslaved Igbo people on various plantations throughout the island on different dates throughout the 18th century. Their presence was a large part in forming Jamaican culture, Igbo cultural influence remains in language, dance, music, folklore, cuisine, religion and mannerisms. In Jamaica the Igbo were often referred to as Eboe or Ibo. There are a substantial number of Igbo language loanwords in Jamaican Patois. Igbo people mostly populated the northwestern section of the island. Originating primarily from what was known as the Bight of Biafra on the West African coast, Igbo people were trafficked in relatively high numbers to Jamaica as a result of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, beginning around 1750. The primary ports from which the majority of these enslaved people were taken from were Bonny and Calabar, two port towns that are now in south-eastern Nigeria. The slave ships arriving from Bristol and Liverpool trafficked enslaved people to the British colonies including Jamaica. The bulk of enslaved Igbo people arrived relatively late, between 1790 and 1807, when the British passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act which outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire. Igbo people were spread on plantations on the island's northwestern side, specifically the areas around Montego Bay and St. Ann's Bay, and consequently, their influence was concentrated there. The region also witnessed a number of revolts that were attributed to people of Igbo origin. Slave owner Matthew Lewis spent time in Jamaica between 1815 and 1817 and studied the way enslaved people he claimed ownership of organised themselves by ethnicity and he noted, for example, that at one time when he ""went down to the negro-houses to hear the whole body of Eboes lodge a complaint against one of the book-keepers"". Olaudah Equiano, a prominent member of the movement for the abolition of the slave trade, was an African-born Igbo formerly enslaved person. On one of his journeys to the Americas as a free man, as documented in his 1789 journal, Equiano was hired by Dr. Charles Irving to r",Culture of Jamaica | Languages of Jamaica | Lists of loanwords | Igbo diaspora | Jamaican people of Igbo descent | Ethnic groups in Jamaica | History of the Colony of Jamaica,"1750, 1776, 1807, 1790, 1791, 1817, 1789, 1815",History | Rebellions and uprisings of enslaved people | Culture | Language | Proverbs | Religion | Notable Jamaicans of Igbo descent | See also,,4504,2025-06-22 19:35:53
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Jamaica,Culture of Jamaica,Jamaica history culture,"Jamaican culture consists of the religion, norms, values, and lifestyle that define the people of Jamaica. The culture is mixed, with an ethnically diverse society, stemming from a history of inhabitants beginning with the original inhabitants of Jamaica (the Taínos). The Spaniards originally brought slavery to Jamaica. Then they were overthrown by the English. Jamaica later gained emancipation on 1 August 1838, and independence from the British on 6 August 1962. Black slaves became the dominant cultural force as they suffered and resisted the harsh conditions of forced labour. After the abolition of slavery, Chinese and Indian migrants were transported to the island as indentured workers, bringing with them ideas from their country.[specify] The official language of Jamaica is Jamaican Standard English, which is used in all official circumstances in the country. In addition to English, there is a creole derivative called Jamaican Patois (pronounced patwa, (/ˈpætwɑː/)) which is the common language among Jamaican citizens. By far, the largest religion in Jamaica is the Christian faith. The Anglican Church, Catholic Church, Methodist Church, Baptists, Seventh-Day Adventists and the Church of God are present throughout the country. Many old churches have been carefully maintained and/or restored. The Rastafari movement is a derivative of the larger Christian culture, but its origins were influenced by rising consciousness of Africa, and an awareness of political events in that continent. There is also a small number of Jewish synagogues in Jamaica, dating from the 17th century along with a few mosques. [citation needed] Elements of ancient African religions remain, especially in remote areas throughout the island. Some of these practices are described generally as Obeah, Kumina, or Pocomania. Though the congregations are small, they are visited by many Christians and non-Christians seeking an experience they have not found in the churches.[vague][citation needed] It is estimated that as much as 40% of the population secretly seek the services of the African traditional religious healers (also called Obeah workers) when confronted with serious problems that conventional medicine cannot remedy.[citation needed][citation needed] The Baháʼí Faith arrived in Jamaica in 1943, brought by an American Baháʼí pioneer, Dr. Malcolm King.

By roughly 800 AD, a second wave of inhabitants occurred by the Arawak tribes, including the Tainos, prior to the arrival of Columbus in 1494. Early inhabitants of Jamaica named the land ""Xaymaca"", meaning ""land of wood and water"". The Spanish enslaved the Arawak, who were ravaged further by diseases that the Spanish brought with them. Early historians believe that by 1602, the Arawak-speaking Taino tribes were extinct. However, some of the Taino escaped into the forested mountains of the interior, where they mixed with runaway African slaves, and survived free from first Spanish, and then English, rule. The Spanish also captured and transported hundreds of West African people to the island for the purpose of slavery. However, the majority of Africans were brought into Jamaica by the English. In 1655, the English invaded Jamaica, and defeated the Spanish. Some African enslaved people took advantage of the political turmoil and escaped to the island's interior mountains, forming independent communities which became known as the Maroons. Meanwhile, on the coast, the English built the settlement of Port Royal, a base of operations where piracy flourished as so many European rebels had been rejected from their countries to serve sentences on the seas.

Sound systems are an important part of Jamaican culture and history, especially with the Windrush generation in Britain. Sound clashes involve crew members from opposing sound systems pitting their DJing and MCing skills against each other in venues or at festivals. The sound system concept first became popular in the 1940s, in the parish of Kingston. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers and set up street parties. Tom the Great Sebastian, founded by Chinese-Jamaican businessman Tom Wong, was the first commercially successful sound system and influenced many sound systems that came later. In the beginning, the DJs played American rhythm and blues music, but as time progressed and more local music was created, the sound migrated to a local flavour. The sound system remained successful when the conservative, BBC-modeled Jamaican establishment radio refused to play the people's music, while DJs could play whatever they wanted and favored local sounds such as reggae. Sound systems were big business, and were one of the few sure ways to make money in the unstable economy of the area. The promoter or DJ made profits by charging admission and selling food and alcohol with often thousands of people in attendance. By the mid-1950s, the sound system was more popular at parties than live musicians, and by the second half of the decade, custom-built systems began to appear from the workshops of specialists such as Hedley Jones, who constructed wardrobe-sized speaker cabinets that he called ""House[s] of Joy"". It was also around this time that Jamaica's first superstar DJ and MC, Count Machuki, rose to prominence. As time progressed, sound systems became louder—capable of playing bass frequencies at 30,000 watts or more, with similar wattage attainable at the mid-range and high frequencies—and far more complex than their predecessors. Competition between these sound systems was fierce, and eventually three DJs emerged as the stars of the scene: Clement ""Coxsone"" Dodd, Duke Reid and King Edwards. Besides the DJ, who rapped over the music, there was also a selector, who selected the music/rhythm tracks. The popularity of a sound system was mainly contingent on one thing: having new music.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica,Jamaica,Jamaica history culture,"Jamaica[a] is an island country in the Caribbean Sea and the West Indies. At 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi), it is the third-largest island—after Cuba and Hispaniola—of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean. Jamaica lies about 145 km (78 nmi) south of Cuba, 191 km (103 nmi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and 215 km (116 nmi) southeast of the Cayman Islands (a British Overseas Territory). With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. The indigenous Taíno peoples of the island gradually came under Spanish rule after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of Africans to Jamaica as slaves. The island remained a possession of Spain, under the name Santiago, until 1655, when England (part of what would become the Kingdom of Great Britain) conquered it and named it Jamaica. It became an important part of the colonial British West Indies. Under Britain's colonial rule, Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on continued importation of African slaves and their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian indentured labourers for plantation work. Jamaicans achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962. Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives. Andrew Holness has served as Prime Minister of Jamaica since March 2016. Jamaica is a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as its king; the appointed representative of the Crown is the Governor-General of Jamaica, the office having been held by Patrick Allen since 2009. Because of a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Most Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_cuisine,Jamaican cuisine,Jamaica history culture,"Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours and spices influenced by Amerindian, West African, Irish, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern people who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by indigenous crops, as well as crops and livestock introduced to the island from Mesoamerica, Europe, tropical West Africa and Southeast Asia— which are now grown locally. A wide variety of seafood, tropical fruits and meats are available. Some Jamaican dishes are variations of cuisines brought to the island from elsewhere, which are often modified to incorporate local produce and spices. Many others are novel or Creole dishes, created from a fusion of dishes, techniques and ingredients from different cultures— which have developed locally over time. Popular Jamaican dishes include curry goat, fried dumplings, brown stew (oxtail), ackee and saltfish and jerk. Jamaican patties along with various pastries, breads and beverages are also popular. Jamaican cuisine has spread with migration, between the mid-17th and 20th centuries. Contingents of Jamaican merchants and labourers, who settled in coastal Latin America, to establish businesses, and work in agriculture and the construction of railroads, ports and the Panama Canal, contributed Jamaican dishes to the region. Also, Jamaicans who have sought economic opportunities in other parts of the world, have spread their culture and culinary practices. The indigenous inhabitants of Jamaica, the Taínos, developed dishes such as jerk meats, roasted fish, bammy, cassava bread and pepperpot (made with callaloo and scotch bonnet pepper). Taíno influence can also be found in dishes like'turned cornmeal, duckunoo, Jamaican hominy corn porridge and Saturday beef soup. They are believed to have kept a stock pot in which meat, fish and vegetables were collected for soup. The Taínos also made intoxicating drinks from cassava and maize, as well as, a tree-bark based drink known for its health benefits, called mauby, which was also made with mâ’bi, the Arawak word for sweet potato. Many native crops and local staples, like peppers (scotch bonnet, cayenne and other cultivars) and beans (like kidney beans) were taken to Jamaica in canoes from Mesoamerica— along with corn, sweet potato, cacao and cassava. They also cultivated chayote (cho cho), coco, squash, pumpkin, yam, peanut, guava, potato, pineapple, starapple, papaya, and other local ingredients.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown,James Brown,James Brown funk,"James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, and record producer. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th-century music, he is referred to by various nicknames, among them ""Mr. Dynamite"", ""the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business"", ""Minister of New Super Heavy Funk"", ""Godfather of Soul"", ""King of Soul"", and ""Soul Brother No. 1"". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first ten inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 23, 1986. His music has been heavily sampled by hip-hop musicians and other artists. Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He rose to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads ""Please, Please, Please"" and ""Try Me"", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" and ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"". During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a new approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" and ""The Payback"". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006. Brown recorded and released 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Byrd,Bobby Byrd,James Brown funk,"Bobby Howard Byrd (August 15, 1934 – September 12, 2007) was an American rhythm and blues, soul and funk singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, bandleader, and talent dedicated. He played a part in the development of soul and funk music in association with James Brown. Bobby Howard Byrd began his career in 1952 as a member of the gospel group, the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling on the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The Famous Flames. Byrd, the founder of ""The Flames,"" is credited with the discovery of James Brown, and also claimed responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in 2012 as a member of The Famous Flames. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award, and was inducted into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame with The Famous Flames in 2020. Bobby Howard Byrd was born in Toccoa, Georgia, to a religiously devout family where they were respected members of the church congregation and active in their neighborhood. Byrd started being active in his local church choir with the gospel group, the Zioneers, later making a name for himself as member of the Gospel Starlighters, which included his sister Sarah. At a time when church elders disapproved of secular singing, the band members would leave their home state and perform in South Carolina as the R&B group the Avons, leaving gospel behind. The original group consisted of Byrd, who played piano and organ and sang lead vocals, Nafloyd Scott, Fred Pulliam, and Doyle Oglesby. In 1952, Bobby Byrd formed and sang with a gospel group called the Gospel Starlighters. During a friendly baseball match at a juvenile prison, he met a young James Brown who was serving time there on robbery charges. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd's family to oversee Brown's parole.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Stubblefield,Clyde Stubblefield,James Brown funk,"Clyde Austin Stubblefield (April 18, 1943 – February 18, 2017) was an American drummer best known for his work with James Brown, with whom he recorded and toured for six years (1965-70). His syncopated drum patterns on Brown's recordings are considered funk standards. Samples of his drum performances (particularly his break in the 1970 track ""Funky Drummer"") were heavily used in hip hop music beginning in the 1980s, although Stubblefield frequently received no credit. A self-taught musician, Stubblefield was influenced by the sound of industrial rhythms he heard in factories and trains. He began playing with local groups in his native Tennessee and later moved to Georgia, where he played with musicians such as Eddie Kirkland and Otis Redding in the early 1960s before joining Brown's band. He later settled in Madison, Wisconsin, where he was a staple of the local music scene. He has been named among the great drummers of all time by various publications. In 2017, he accepted an honorary degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Born to Frank D. and Vena Stubblefield on April 18, 1943, he grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was inspired to pursue drumming after seeing drummers for the first time in a parade. As a youngster his sense of rhythm was influenced by the industrial sounds of factories and trains around him. He practiced the rhythm patterns he heard, sometimes playing two patterns simultaneously. Years later he said if he could hum a drum pattern, he could play it. He played professionally as a teenager and performed in local bands such as Blue Shufflers, Inclines, and Cascades. In the early 1960s he moved to Macon, Georgia, and worked with guitarist Eddie Kirkland and toured with Otis Redding. In 1965, James Brown saw Stubblefield perform in Macon, Georgia, and asked him to audition. Soon after he joined Brown's band. Over the next six years the band had two drummers, Stubblefield and John ""Jabo"" Starks who had joined the band two weeks earlier.

Wikipedia,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy,_Sexy,_Sexy","Sexy, Sexy, Sexy",James Brown funk,"""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"" is a 1973 song written and recorded by James Brown, for the film Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. The song appeared on the film's soundtrack, and was released as a single in 1973. The song, and wider album, emerged from an era which saw the rise of blaxploitation films. Such films represented the struggle of African Americans against poverty and crime under a white-dominated society. While ""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"" was received well by contemporary and modern audiences alike, it received negative reviews from critics. Brown used the same backing track and chord progression from his 1966 hit ""Money Won't Change You"" when composing the song, which prompted a poor critical response. Despite Brown's reuse of his earlier work, ""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"" showcased the typical funk hallmarks of his more popular work. The song performed strongly on three separate Billboard charts as well as the Cashbox chart. It appeared in three separate releases under music label Polydor Records and reissued in 2020. In the early 1970s the United States saw the rise of ethnic blaxploitation films focussed on the contemporary experience and oppression of African Americans. The films pioneered the use of original funk and soul soundtrack albums composed specifically for the films by prolific African American artists of the era. By using famous black composers of the 1960s and 1970s, the films showcased the musical and cinematic capabilities of African American creators. The soundtracks utilized defining conventions of soul, blues and funk music to encapsulate both the spirit as well as the struggle of African American communities against overbearing white authorities. Examples of such soundtracks and artists include Curtis Mayfield's Super Fly, Isaac Hayes in Shaft, and Earth, Wind & Fire for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. James Brown was approached to author the soundtracks for two blaxploitation films. The first being Black Caesar, a 1973 remake of the 1931 film Little Caesar, revamped to represent the current African American experience. The film introduced Brown to his first experience in writing musical material in the form of a cinematic score. Brown wrote ten songs and performed on all tracks for the album, with assistance from Charles Bobbit and Fred Wesley. Brown's second effort at score composure was in 1973 when he wrote the soundtrack for Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. The film was the sequel to the 1972 film, Slaughter. Both films focus on the titular character of Slaughter",James Brown songs | Songs written by James Brown | 1973 singles | 1973 songs | Polydor Records singles,"1931, 1973, 1972, 1966, 2020",Background | Critical reception | Composition | Lyrics | Chart performance | Releases | References | External links,Released: 1973 | Genre: Funk | Length: 3:11 | Label: Polydor | Songwriter(s): James Brown,3750,2025-06-22 19:37:47

It was advertised as his final album before retiring, which is also a recurring theme throughout the songs, although Jay-Z resumed his recording career in 2005. For the album, Jay-Z wanted to enlist a different producer for each song, working with Just Blaze, Kanye West, the Neptunes, Eminem, DJ Quik, Timbaland, 9th Wonder and Rick Rubin, among others. The album also features a guest appearance by Pharrell Williams. The Black Album was promoted with a retirement tour by Jay-Z. It was also supported by three singles: ""99 Problems"", also the Billboard top-ten hits ""Change Clothes"" and ""Dirt off Your Shoulder"". The album received widespread acclaim from music critics and was a massive commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 463,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's top selling record of the 2000s decade, and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2023. The songs ""Encore"", ""Dirt off Your Shoulder"", and ""99 Problems"" are all on the mashup EP, Collision Course with Linkin Park. In 2004, American musician Danger Mouse released The Grey Album, a mashup/remix album which features the vocals of The Black Album and the instrumental of The Beatles' self-titled album, colloquially known as the ""White Album"", in which it became controversial at the album's release. The Black Album was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 84, based on 19 reviews. AllMusic's John Bush claimed Jay-Z was retiring at his peak with the album. Vibe magazine said it was remarkable as an apotheosis of his genuinely thoughtful songwriting and lyrics ""delivered with transcendent skill"", while Steve Jones from USA Today said even with ""top-shelf work"" from elite producers, the album was elevated by Jay-Z's uniquely deft and diverse rapping style. Writing for The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin felt Jay-Z returned to ""brevity and consistency"" on an album that demonstrated his lyrical abilities and, more importantly, hip hop's best producers.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z,Jay-Z,Jay-Z rapper,"Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z,[a] is an American rapper, businessman, and record executive. Rooted in East Coast hip-hop, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023. Known for his complex lyrical ability—which often uses double entendres and word play—and braggadocio, his music is built upon a rags to riches narrative. He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year. A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017), debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the joint-record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart (tied with Drake and Taylor Swift). He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly, Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé. He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single ""Empire State of Mind"" (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles ""Heartbreaker"" by Mariah Carey, ""Crazy in Love"" by Beyoncé, and ""Umbrella"" by Rihanna. Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019. In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company's media streaming service. As of May 2025, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion. One of the world's best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 25 Grammy Awards, the eighth-most of all time and the most awarded for any hip-hop artist.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover_(Jay-Z_song),Takeover (Jay-Z song),Jay-Z rapper,"""Takeover"" is a track recorded by Jay-Z for his 2001 album The Blueprint. The song is a diss track aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy of Mobb Deep. This song was the first official LP diss track to publicize directly the hip hop feud between Jay-Z and Nas (although there exist several other rap records prior to this featuring disses from both Nas and Jay-Z toward each other). ""Takeover"" was produced by Kanye West and samples The Doors' ""Five to One"" as well as ""Sound of da Police"" by KRS-One. The first line in this song is taken from Jay-Z's verse in ""Celebration"" off of the Streets Is Watching soundtrack. The song also interpolates David Bowie's ""Fame"". The line ""Get zipped up in plastic, when it happens, that's it"" is borrowed from ""The Watcher"" by Dr. Dre. Jay-Z originally performed the first two verses of ""Takeover"" as an untitled diss to Prodigy of Mobb Deep at Hot 97's Summer Jam 2001. While performing the line ""you was a ballerina/ I got the pictures I seen ya"" a photograph of Prodigy, as a child, dressed as Michael Jackson, appeared on the large screen. He also mocks Prodigy's small stature. Jay-Z further dismisses Mobb Deep as competition in the hip hop industry by pointing out that his career had more commercial success than they ever would, and dissing Mobb Deep's famous song ""Shook Ones Pt. II"". The third verse has 32 bars, while the other verses have 16; in it, Jay-Z ridicules Nas' discography (at the time consisting of four albums) and claims Nas has a ""one hot album every ten year average."" Jay-Z referred to a widespread feeling from many hip hop critics and artists that Nas' subsequent albums after his legendary debut Illmatic were mediocre, and dissed Nas' famous song from Illmatic, ""The World Is Yours"". Jay-Z previously sampled some of Nas' lines for the chorus of Jay-Z's famous song ""Dead Presidents II"". In ""Takeover"", Jay-Z claims he sampled Nas' lines to use them more impressively: ""So yeah I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/ You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song"". Jay-Z also questions Nas' street credibility and claims Nas has lied or exaggerated about his past in songs, with the lines, ""Nigga, you ain't live it you witnessed from your folks' pad/Scribbled in your notepad and created your life/I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me! That's who!)/Then I heard your album 'bout your TEC on your dresser."" (This is a reference to the Illmatic song ""Represent"").

Written by all three, the song appears as the 12th track on the former's sixth album The Blueprint. It was originally a collaboration between Eminem and Royce da 5'9"" as part of the Bad Meets Evil series, but Royce was later replaced by Jay-Z. The original can be found on mixtapes and has been leaked onto the internet. The Jay-Z version of the song, released in 2001 as featured on The Blueprint, was later included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of Eminem's 2005 greatest hits album, Curtain Call: The Hits. ""Renegade"" was originally recorded by Bad Meets Evil, a hip hop duo with members Eminem and Royce da 5'9"". During the recording of Royce da 5'9""'s debut studio album Rock City, to be released via Columbia Records, Interscope Records informed Royce da 5'9"" that they would only allow one Eminem collaboration on the album, forcing him to choose between two songs the pair had recorded together: the title track and ""Renegade"". He chose the former, which went on to be released as the album's first single, leaving ""Renegade"" unreleased for the time being. During an interview on the MTV show RapFix Live in 2011, Eminem revealed that he had initially intended to present Jay-Z with an entirely different production when the latter reached out and asked him to work on The Blueprint: however, Eminem did not have physical access to the reel it was recorded on at the time. Knowing Jay-Z was working to a short deadline, Eminem decided to offer him ""Renegade"" instead. After Royce da 5'9"" granted his approval, Jay-Z recorded his own vocals in place of Royce's and sent them back to Eminem, who mixed them together into the final version of the song. The song is referenced by rapper Nas on his famous Jay-Z diss song ""Ether"" made during their highly publicized feud. Nas says to Jay-Z that ""Eminem murdered you on your own shit;"" stating that he felt Eminem outperformed Jay-Z on his own song. Nas and Jay-Z had both contributed to the soundtrack of Eminem's 2002 film 8 Mile, with Nas' contribution, ""U Wanna Be Me"", being a diss towards Jay-Z.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz,Jazz,Jazz African American origins,"Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its roots are in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging ""musician's music"" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz. The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning 'pep, energy'. The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league",Jazz | African-American cultural history | African-American music | American styles of music | Jazz terminology | Musical improvisation | Popular music | Radio formats,"1860, 1912",Etymology and definition | Elements | Improvisation | Traditionalism | Diversity in jazz | Jazz and race | Roles of women | Jews in jazz,"Etymology: See: Jazz (word) | Stylistic origins: Blues

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_dance,Jazz dance,Jazz African American origins,"Jazz Dance is a performance dance and style that arose in the United States in the early 20th century. Jazz Dance may allude to vernacular Jazz, Broadway or dramatic Jazz. The two types expand on African American vernacular styles of dance that arose with Jazz Music. Vernacular dance refers to dance forms that emerge from everyday life and cultural practices of a specific community, often reflecting the social, cultural, and historical contexts of that community. In the context of African American culture, vernacular dance encompasses styles that developed organically within African American communities, influenced by African traditions, European dance forms, and the unique experiences of African Americans in the United States. Vernacular Jazz Dance incorporates ragtime moves, Charleston, Lindy hop and mambo. Popular vernacular Jazz Dance performers include The Whitman Sisters, Florence Mills, Ethel Waters, Al Minns and Leon James, Frankie Manning, Norma Miller, Dawn Hampton, and Katherine Dunham. Dramatic Jazz Dance performed on the show stage was promoted by Jack Cole, Bob Fosse, Eugene Louis Faccuito, and Gus Giordano. The term ""Jazz Dance"" has been used in ways that have little or nothing to do with jazz music. Since the 1940s, Hollywood movies and Broadway shows have used the term to describe the choreographies of Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins. In the 1990s, colleges and universities applied the term to classes offered by physical education departments in which students dance to various forms of pop music, in addition to jazz. Some jazz dance classes may use electroswing music, which is a style combining jazz with electronic dance music. The history of modern Jazz Dance is intertwined with the cultural and social experiences of African Americans, tracing its roots back to African dance traditions. Key characteristics of traditional African dance included the use of bent knees, complex rhythms, and the isolation of body parts, all of which contributed to a dynamic and expressive form of movement. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, black performance art began to gain visibility in the United States. The emergence of Vaudeville and minstrel shows provided platforms for black entertainers to showcase their talents. These performances often included dance, music, and comedy, reflecting the everyday lives and experiences of black people.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture,African-American culture,Jazz African American origins,"African-American culture, also known as Black American culture or Black culture in American English, refers to the cultural expressions of African Americans, either as part of or distinct from mainstream American culture. African-American/Black-American culture has been influential on American and global worldwide culture as a whole. Black-American/African American culture primarily refers to the distinct cultural expressions, traditions, and contributions of people who are descendants of those enslaved in the United States, as well as free people of color who lived in the country before 1865. This culture is rooted in a specific ethnic group and is separate from the cultures of more recent melanated (dark-skinned) immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, or Afro-Latinos. African American culture is not simply defined by race or historical struggle but is deeply rooted in shared practices, identity, and community. African American culture encompasses many aspects, including spiritual beliefs, social customs, lifestyles, and worldviews. When blended together these have allowed African Americans to create successes and excel in the areas of literature, media, cinema, music, architecture, art, politics, and business, as well as cuisine marriage, and family. A relatively unknown aspect of African American culture is the significant impact it has had on both science and industry. Some elements of African American culture come from within the community, others from the interaction of African Americans with the wider diaspora of people of African origin displaced throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, and others still from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community. In addition, African American culture is influenced by Indigenous African Culture, and Native American culture.[citation needed]",African-American cultural history | African-American society | Culture of the Southern United States,1865,African-American cultural history | Shared history in the Americas | Oral tradition | Harlem Renaissance | African-American cultural movement | Music | Contemporary | The arts,,1828,2025-06-22 19:33:12

Initially regarded as governor-general, Dessalines was later named Emperor of Haiti as Jacques I (1804–1806) by generals of the Haitian Revolutionary army and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806. He spearheaded the resistance against French rule of Saint-Domingue, and eventually became the architect of the 1804 massacre of the remaining French residents of newly independent Haiti, including some supporters of the revolution. Alongside Toussaint Louverture, he has been referred to as one of the fathers of the nation of Haiti. Under the rule of Dessalines, Haiti became the first country in the Americas to permanently abolish slavery. Dessalines served as an officer in the French army when Saint-Domingue was fending off Spanish and British incursions. Later he rose to become a commander in the revolt against France. As Toussaint Louverture's principal lieutenant, he led many successful engagements, including the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot. In 1802, Louverture was betrayed and captured, and sent to prison in France, where he died. Thereafter, Dessalines became the leader of the revolution and Général-Chef de l'Armée Indigène on 18 May 1803. His forces defeated the French army at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803. Saint-Domingue was declared independent on 29 November and then as the independent Republic of Haiti on 1 January 1804, under the leadership of Dessalines, chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of governor-general. He ordered the 1804 Haitian massacre of the remaining French population in Haiti, killing between 3,000 and 5,000 people, including women and children, and an exodus of thousands. Some modern historians classify the massacre as a genocide due to its systemic nature. Some historians cite the threat of a French reinvasion and reinstatement of slavery as one of the reasons for the massacre. Dessalines excluded surviving Polish Legionnaires, who had defected from the French, as well as Germans who did not take part in the slave trade. He granted them full citizenship and classified them as black. Tensions remained with the minority mixed-race population, who had gained some education and property during the colonial period.

It is named after Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a leader of the Haitian Revolution and the first ruler and emperor of independent Haiti. During that period L'Éstère city was a major city in the Artibonite Valley. Marchand at that time was a habitation probably belonging to a French name Marchand. During the Haitian revolution, Dessalines organized most of his troops from the town of Petite Riviere de Artibonite. Dessalines asked Pétion to lay a plan for a new city that would become the capital of free Haiti over the habitation Marchand. In 1804 the town was made the capital of the newly independent state of Haiti. It was renamed after Jean-Jacques Dessalines in honor of the first Haitian head of state. The imperial constitution of 20 May 1805 was proclaimed from the town of Dessalines. After the emperor's assassination in October 1806 Port-au-Prince was declared the new capital of Haiti.[citation needed] The commune lay in the Artibonite Valley, on the north shore of the river at the bottom of the Montagne Noir mountain range.

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Born and raised in North Carolina, after graduating from high school Coltrane moved to Philadelphia, where he studied music. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was one of the players at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension, as exemplified on his most acclaimed album A Love Supreme (1965) and others. Decades after his death, Coltrane remains influential, and he has received numerous posthumous awards, including a special Pulitzer Prize, and was canonized by the African Orthodox Church. His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane. The couple had three children: John Jr. (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), a saxophonist, guitarist, drummer and singer. Coltrane was born in his parents' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina, on September 23, 1926. His father was John R. Coltrane and his mother was Alice Blair. He grew up in High Point, North Carolina, and attended William Penn High School. While in high school, Coltrane played clarinet and alto horn in a community band before switching to the saxophone, after being influenced by the likes of Lester Young and Johnny Hodges. Beginning in December 1938, his father, aunt, and grandparents died within a few months of one another, leaving him to be raised by his mother and a close cousin. In June 1943, shortly after graduating from high school, Coltrane and his family moved to Philadelphia, where he got a job at a sugar refinery. In September that year, his 17th birthday, his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto. From 1944 to 1945, Coltrane took saxophone lessons at the Ornstein School of Music with Mike Guerra. Between early to mid-1945, he had his first professional work as a musician: a ""cocktail lounge trio"" with piano and guitar.",John Coltrane | 1926 births | 1967 deaths | 20th-century American male musicians | 20th-century American saxophonists | 20th-century Christian saints | 20th-century American flautists | 20th-century American jazz composers,"1965, 1967, 1982, 1926, 1938, 1943, 1964",Biography | 1926–1945: Early life | 1945–1946: Military service | 1946–1954: Immediate post-war career | 1955–1957: Miles and Monk period | 1958: Davis and Coltrane | 1959–1961: Period with Atlantic Records | 1961–1962: First years with Impulse!

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltrane_Jazz,Coltrane Jazz,John Coltrane jazz,"Coltrane Jazz is a studio album by the jazz musician John Coltrane. It was released in early 1961 on Atlantic Records. Most of the album features Coltrane playing with his former Miles Davis bandmates, pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb during two sessions in November and December, 1959. The exception is the track ""Village Blues"", which was recorded October 21, 1960. ""Village Blues"" comes from the first recording session featuring Coltrane playing with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones, who toured and recorded with Coltrane as part of his celebrated ""classic quartet"" from 1960 to 1965. In 1959, Miles Davis' business manager Harold Lovett negotiated a contract for Coltrane with Atlantic, the terms including a $7000 annual guarantee. After having recorded most of Giant Steps in May of that year, Coltrane started having bridge problems, and did not return to a recording studio for six months. When he returned to the studio in November and December for the Coltrane Jazz recording sessions, he employed the rhythm section from the Miles Davis Quintet. The sessions yielded the bulk of Coltrane Jazz, and the track ""Naima,"" which was included on the Giant Steps album. ""Like Sonny,"" a tribute to colleague Sonny Rollins, is based on a melodic figure that Sonny Rollins can be heard playing at 3:22 during his solo on ""My Old Flame"" on Kenny Dorham's 1957 album Jazz Contrasts. (Coltrane made one further studio recording of ""Like Sonny"" in September 1960 for Roulette Records, who issued the piece under the title ""Simple Like"" in 1962 on the album ""The Best of Birdland: Volume 1"".) After leaving Davis's band in the spring of 1960, Coltrane formed his first touring quartet for a residency at the Jazz Gallery club in Manhattan. Coltrane initially hired pianist Steve Kuhn and drummer Pete ""La Roca"" Sims for his group, along with bassist Steve Davis, but by September, the quartet's rhythm section consisted of Tyner, Jones, and Davis. This group entered the studio on October 21, recording ""Village Blues"" at the beginning of the week of sessions that produced Coltrane's My Favorite Things album. On June 20, 2000, Rhino Records reissued Coltrane Jazz as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included were four bonus tracks, two of which had appeared in 1975 on the Atlantic compilation Alternate Takes, the remaining pair earlier issued on The Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings in 1995.

An accomplished pianist and one of the few harpists in the history of jazz, Coltrane recorded many albums as a bandleader, beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s for Impulse! and other record labels. She was married to the jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane, with whom she performed in 1966–1967. One of the foremost proponents of spiritual jazz, her eclectic music proved influential both within and outside the world of jazz. Coltrane's career slowed from the mid-1970s as she became more dedicated to her religious education. She founded the Vedantic Center in 1975 and the Shanti Anantam ashram in California in 1983, where she served as spiritual director. On July 3, 1994, she rededicated and inaugurated the land as Sai Anantam Ashram. During the 1980s and 1990s, she recorded several albums of Hindu devotional songs before returning to spiritual jazz in the 2000s and releasing her final album Translinear Light in 2004.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane_discography,John Coltrane discography,John Coltrane jazz,"This article presents the discography of the American jazz saxophonist and bandleader John Coltrane (1926–1967). Coltrane participated in his first recording sessions while enlisted in the Navy from August 6, 1945, to August 11, 1946. He performed eight numbers in a pickup band that included trumpeter Dexter Culbertson. These were private recordings not made for official release. However, one track from the session, ""Hot House"", eventually appeared on the 1992 compilation The Last Giant: The John Coltrane Anthology. There are conflicting sources as to whether he made his first professional recording session with Dinah Washington: Jazzdisco.org lists the session as September 27, 1949 in New York City, but Lewis Porter's John Coltrane: His Life and Music states that he was on tour with the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band during that time. Most sources confirm that he recorded with Billy Valentine on November 7 in Los Angeles for Mercury Records. In subsequent years, Coltrane sat in on recording sessions with Gillespie, Johnny Hodges, Earl Bostic, and Gay Crosse. In September 1955, Coltrane joined the Miles Davis Quintet and appeared on several Miles Davis-led recordings, including 'Round About Midnight and Milestones. He briefly joined Thelonious Monk in May 1957, and their handful of recordings together have been collected on albums such as 1961's Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane_and_Johnny_Hartman,John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,John Coltrane jazz,"John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is a studio album by John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman which was released by Impulse! Records in July or August 1963. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. Although it is often reported that Coltrane and Hartman had known each other since their days playing with Dizzy Gillespie's band in the late 1940s, their time in the band never overlapped. Coltrane might have heard Hartman sing at a 1950 Apollo Theater performance at which they shared the stage. Hartman is the only vocalist with whom the saxophonist would record as a leader. Initially when producer Bob Thiele approached Hartman with Coltrane's request that the two record together, Hartman was hesitant as he did not consider himself a jazz singer and did not think he and Coltrane would complement one another musically. However, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York City to see if they could work something out. Hartman did and after the club closed, he, Coltrane and Coltrane's pianist, McCoy Tyner, went over some songs together. On March 7, 1963, Coltrane and Hartman had decided on 10 songs for the record album, but en route to the studio they heard Nat King Cole on the radio performing ""Lush Life"", and Hartman immediately decided that song had to be included in their album. They recorded on March 7, 1963, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Hartman later said that each song was done in only one take, except for ""You Are Too Beautiful"", which required two takes because Elvin Jones dropped one of his drumsticks during the first take. Jazz writer Michael Cuscuna explains the speculation of two different versions of the album: ""At a later date, Coltrane decided to overdub some additional obbligato saxophone phrases behind Hartman's vocals on 'My One and Only Love', 'Lush Life' and 'You Are Too Beautiful'. A new master was made by Rudy Van Gelder, who added some additional echo to the three tracks. Although the first release of the album used the original master without Coltrane's additional obbligatos, it was later substituted with the new master.""",1963 collaborative albums | John Coltrane albums | Johnny Hartman albums | Impulse!

The other three important international airports in Kenya include Kisumu International Airport, Moi International Airport and Eldoret International Airport. Located in the Embakasi suburb 18 kilometres (11 mi) southeast of Nairobi's central business district, the airport has scheduled flights to destinations in over 50 countries. Originally named Embakasi Airport, the airport's name was changed in 1978 to honour Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president and Prime Minister. The airport served over 7 million passengers in 2016, making it the seventh busiest airport in passenger traffic on the continent. The postal code for Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is 00501. Discussions about building the airport date back to 1945. At that time, the colonial power—Britain—and its national airline, BOAC, were worried that the existing airport at Eastleigh was inadequate for post-War civilian airliners. The costs of improving Eastleigh versus developing a new airport occupied planners for eight years. Who would pay was a major issue. Plans for the airport were drawn up in 1953, work started in January 1954, and by mid-1957 it was found possible to bring the operational date forward to mid-March 1958.[citation needed] The task was by no means straightforward, and many problems —largely of a civil engineering nature—had to be overcome before the runway could be built. An extensive amount of the airport's construction was done utilizing forced labour, many of whom were suspected of being Mau Mau members. Due to the enormous pressure to finish the airport and the high amount of labour necessary, it was not uncommon to work the labourers to the point where some of them died of exhaustion. The working conditions were so poor that were reports of suicides and self-mutilation among the labourers. The site chosen, on a lava plain 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the centre of Nairobi (the city's two other airports, Eastleigh and Wilson, are closer), has approaches free from any obstruction for at least 18 km (11 mi) in any direction.[citation needed]",Transport in Nairobi | Airports in Kenya | Airports established in 1958 | Jomo Kenyatta,"1958, 1953, 1945, 2016, 1978, 1954, 1957","History | 1950s and 1960s | 1970s, 1980s and 1990s | 2000–present | 2013 fire | 2024 strike | Facilities | Terminals","Airport type: Public | Operator: Kenya Airports Authority | Serves: Nairobi Metropolitan Region | Location: Embakasi, Nairobi, Kenya",2208,2025-06-22 19:39:41

Jomo Kenyatta, a KANU member, took office following the formation of the republic of Kenya after independence following his efforts during the fight for Independence. Four years later, in the 1969 elections, he was the sole candidate and was elected unopposed for a second term in office. In 1974, he was re-elected for a third term. Although the post of President of Kenya was due to be elected at the same time as the National Assembly, Jomo Kenyatta was the sole candidate and was automatically elected without a vote being held. He died on 22 August 1978 while still in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. In December 1964, Kenya was officially proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its executive president, combining the roles of head of state and head of government. Although the position for presidency was open for election, Kenyatta was the sole unopposed candidate and was thus proclaimed president without any voting for that position. The bid to have Kenyatta named the unopposed president followed a systematic elimination of opposition candidates during his time as prime minister of Kenya. The May 1963 general election pitted Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various independent candidates. KANU was victorious with 83 seats out of 124 in the House of Representatives; a KANU majority government replaced the pre-existing coalition. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta was sworn in as prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. Immediately following his swearing in as president, Kenyatta faced domestic opposition and in January 1964, sections of the army launched a mutiny in Nairobi, with Kenyatta calling on the British Army to put down the rebellion. Similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighboring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny. He publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasizing the need for law and order in Kenya. To prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises. Kenyatta also wanted to contain parliamentary opposition and at Kenyatta's prompting, in November 1964 KADU officially dissolved and its representatives joined KANU. Two of the senior members of KADU, Ronald Ngala and Daniel arap Moi, subsequently became some of Kenyatta'",Presidencies of Kenya | Political history of Kenya | 1964 establishments in Kenya | 1978 disestablishments in Africa | Jomo Kenyatta,"1963, 1978, 1974, 1964, 1969","1964 presidential election | Election process and results | Inauguration and cabinet | Legislation and decisions office | Economic policy | Land, healthcare, and education reform | Foreign policy | Dissent and the one-party state",President: Jomo Kenyatta | Party: KANU | Seat: State House,3193,2025-06-22 19:39:43

He played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and a conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death. Kenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961. On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival—Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union—from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya's army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War.

Kenyatta served as the member of parliament (MP) for Gatundu South from 2002 to 2013 and also as Deputy Prime Minister to Raila Odinga from 2008 to 2013.[citation needed] Currently he is a member and the party leader of the Jubilee Party of Kenya, whose popularity has since dwindled. Kenyatta was previously a member of the Kenya Africa National Union (KANU), a political party that had led Kenya to independence in 1963. He resigned from KANU in 2012 and joined The National Alliance (TNA), one of the allied parties that campaigned for his election victory during the 2013 election. He later on went to form a merger with the United Republican Party (URP) led by William Ruto to form the Jubilee Party. Kenyatta was re-elected for a second and final term in the August 2017 general elections, winning 54% of the popular vote. The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati. However, Uhuru's election was challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling. A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39.03% electoral voter participation. Uhuru Kenyatta was born on 26 October 1961, to the first president of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, and his fourth wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta (née Muhoho). The second born in the family, he has two sisters, Christine (born 1953), Anna Nyokabi (born 1963) and a brother, Muhoho Kenyatta (born 1965).","1961 births | Living people | Kenyan Roman Catholics | Alumni of St. Mary's School, Nairobi | Amherst College alumni | Children of presidents of Kenya | Children of prime ministers of Kenya | Government ministers of Kenya","2008, 1961, 2022, 2002, 2013",Early life | Political life | International Criminal Court Charges | The National Alliance Party (TNA) | By-elections (17 September 2012) | 2013 presidential elections | Results dispute | Supreme Court Judgement,Deputy: William Ruto | Preceded by: Mwai Kibaki | Succeeded by: William Ruto,2132,2025-06-22 19:39:45

He governed Tanganyika as prime minister from 1961 to 1962 and then as president from 1962 to 1964, after which he led its successor state, Tanzania, as president from 1964 to 1985. He was a founding member and chair of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) party and of its successor, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, from 1954 to 1990. Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he promoted a political philosophy known as Ujamaa. Born in Butiama, Mara, then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a Zanaki chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at Makerere College in Uganda and then Edinburgh University in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked as a school teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan independence from the British Empire. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the Legislative Council in the 1958–1959 elections, Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the 1960 general election, becoming prime minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere elected as its first president. His administration pursued decolonisation and the ""Africanisation"" of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans and the country's Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a one-party state and unsuccessfully pursued the Pan-Africanist formation of an East African Federation with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British assistance. Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964, the island of Zanzibar was unified with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. After this, Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national self-reliance and socialism. Although his socialism differed from that promoted by Marxism–Leninism, Tanzania developed close links with Mao Zedong's China. In 1967, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration which outlined his vision of ujamaa. Banks and other major industries and companies were nationalized; education and healthcare were significantly expanded.

The total area of the park is 30,893 km2 (11,928 sq mi) and covers the big part of Liwale District in western Lindi Region, south west Pwani Region, north eastern Ruvuma Region and a big part of south eastern Morogoro Region. The park is about the size of Belgium (Europe). Much of the area is in a wild state without being altered by human activities. The part of Selous game reserve is now running a hydro electric power. The park has a great river known as Rufiji River. Rufiji is Tanzania's largest river and is home to many crocodiles and hippopotamuses. It is also one of largest mangrove forests in the world located at its delta. The original Selous Game Reserve traces its roots to 1896 when the then German Governor of Tanganyika proclaimed this vast area as a protected wildlife hunting reserve. Sometime in 1922 the reserve was named after Frederick Selous, a big game hunter turned wildlife conservationist. In 2019, it was decided by the Government of Tanzania that to further develop and enhance tourism in Selous, the northern part of the reserve will be excised to form the a new national park to be known as the Nyerere National Park, in honor of the first President of Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere. This new park was formally gazetted as a National Park in 2019 and now falls under the administration of TANAPA (Tanzania National Parks Authority ). Nyerere National Park has a high level of biodiversity, with the most iconic African species all inhabiting the region in some capacity, including lions, leopards, Masai giraffe, herds of wildebeest and plains zebra, black rhinoceros, impala, Thomson's gazelle, spotted hyenas, countess birds, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates. A large number of hippopotamus and Nile crocodiles inhabit the waters of the Rufiji River. Most notably, the park is known for its prolific population of endangered African wild dogs. In the mid-1970s, Selous Game Reserve (and, by extension, Nyerere National Park) was home to a large number of elephants and rhinos, with estimates on the total number of elephants being over 100,000.

The former was a colony and part of German East Africa from the 1880s to 1919 when, under the League of Nations, it became a British mandate. It served as a British mir II]], providing financial help, munitions, and soldiers. In 1947, Tanganyika became a United Nations Trust Territory under British administration, a status it kept until its independence in 1961. The island of Zanzibar thrived as a trading hub, successively controlled by the Portuguese, the Sultanate of Oman, and then as a British protectorate by the end of the nineteenth century. Julius Nyerere, independence leader and ""baba wa taifa"" (father of the nation) for Tanganyika, ruled the country for decades, while Abeid Amaan Karume, governed Zanzibar as its president and Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Following Nyerere's retirement in 1985, various political and economic reforms began. He was succeeded in office by President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Tanzania is home to some of the oldest hominid settlements unearthed by archaeologists. Prehistoric stone tools and fossils have been found in and around Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, an area often referred to as ""The Cradle of Mankind"". Acheulian stone tools were discovered there in 1931 by Louis Leakey, after he had correctly identified the rocks brought back by Hans Reck to Germany from his 1913 Olduvai expedition as stone tools. The same year, Louis Leakey found older, more primitive stone tools in Olduvai Gorge. These were the first examples of the oldest human technology ever discovered in Africa, and were subsequently known throughout the world as Oldowan after Olduvai Gorge. The first hominid skull in Olduvai Gorge was discovered by Mary Leakey in 1959, and named Zinj or Nutcracker Man, the first example of Paranthropus boisei, and is thought to be more than 1.8 million years old. Other finds including Homo habilis fossils were subsequently made. At nearby Laetoli the oldest known hominid footprints, the Laetoli footprints, were discovered by Mary Leakey in 1978, and estimated to be approximately 3.6 million years old and probably made by Australopithecus afarensis. The oldest hominid fossils ever discovered in Tanzania also come from Laetoli and are the 3.6 to 3.8 million year old remains of Australopithecus afarens",History of Tanzania | History of East Africa by country,"1985, 1931, 1919, 1959, 1961, 1978, 1935, 1947, 1964, 1913",Prehistory | Early Stone Age | Middle Stone Age | Later Stone Age and Pastoral Neolithic | Iron Age | Early coastal history | Tanganyika (1850–1890) | German East Africa,,2799,2025-06-22 19:39:50
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth,Juneteenth,Juneteenth celebration,"Juneteenth, officially Juneteenth National Independence Day, is a federal holiday in the United States. It is celebrated annually on June 19 to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. The holiday's name, first used in the 1890s, is a combination of the words June and nineteenth, referring to June 19, 1865, the day when Major General Gordon Granger ordered the final enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas at the end of the American Civil War. In the Civil War period, slavery came to an end in various areas of the United States at different times. Many enslaved Southerners escaped, demanded wages, stopped work, or took up arms against the Confederacy of slave states. In January 1865, Congress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for the national abolition of slavery. By June 1865, almost all of the enslaved population had been freed by the victorious Union Army or by state abolition laws. When the national abolition amendment was ratified in December, the remaining enslaved people in Delaware and in Kentucky were freed. Early Juneteenth celebrations date back to 1866, at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. They spread across the South among newly freed African-Americans and their descendants and became more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food festival. Participants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations to the rest of the country. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Juneteenth celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to achieve civil rights, but they grew in popularity again in the 1970s, with a focus on African-American freedom and African-American arts. Beginning with Texas by proclamation in 1938, and by legislation in 1979, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has formally recognized the holiday in some way. Juneteenth is also celebrated by the Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in 1852 and settled in Coahuila, Mexico. The day was recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, when the 117th U.S. Congress enacted and President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law. Juneteenth became the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was adopted in 1983.",Juneteenth | 1866 establishments in Texas | Abolitionism in the United States | African-American culture | African-American events | African-American festivals | African-American history of Texas | African-American history between emancipation and the civil rights movement,"1865, 1983, 1979, 1852, 1866, 1938, 2021",Celebrations and traditions | History | Early history | Revival of celebrations | The Juneteenth Flag | Legal observance | State and local holiday | Federal holiday,"Official name: Juneteenth National Independence Day | Also called: Jubilee Day[1]

The first version was created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith and that early version was displayed in 1997. The present version was first flown in 2000. The colors and symbols on the flag are representative of freedom and the end of slavery. The date on the flag represents that of General Order No. 3 issued in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865. Beginning in 2020, many states began recognizing Juneteenth by flying the flag over their state capitol buildings, especially after Juneteenth was declared a federal holiday by President Joe Biden the following year. The Juneteenth flag was designed in 1997 by activist Ben Haith (also known as ""Boston Ben""). Haith displayed the first version of the Juneteenth flag in June 1997 at Boston's John Eliot Square District. It was described by Patricia Smith of the Boston Globe as, ""A banner adorned with sunbursts and flaming candles"". A revised design was copyrighted by Haith in 2000. Haith also founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Lisa Jeanne Graf reports that as an illustrator she fine-tuned the design for the NJCF. The flag uses the colors red, white and blue of the American flag. Featured prominently in the center of the flag is a bursting star. Running through the center of the flag horizontally, is an arc that is meant to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for black people. According to the president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation Steve Williams, the star is a ""Bursting star of freedom."" Williams also states that the arch representing the horizon shows blue above and the red color below is symbolic of the ground soaked with blood; the blood which was shed of the Black Americans enslaved by the United States. The red, white, and blue colors were meant to convey the message that all enslaved people in the United States -- as well as their descendants -- are American. In 2007, the date ""June 19, 1865"" was added. The five-pointed star refers both to Texas (nicknamed the ""Lone Star state"") and to the ""freedom of African Americans in all 50 states"".

Consisting of 100 townhomes, Scotland community's roots date back to the late 19th century, when former slaves bought land in Potomac. Beginning in the late 1870s and through the 1880s, former slaves began to take ownership of what would become the Scotland property. Two principal early families were the Masons and Doves, with descendants still living in the community. This was one of about 40 communities former slaves formed in Montgomery County. Today, these historic African American enclaves include Lincoln Park in Rockville, Ken-Gar in Kensington, Tobytown in Potomac, Stewartown and Emory Grove in Gaithersburg, and Lyttonsville in Silver Spring. Known as ""Snakes Den"" until the 1920s, Scotland's approximately 50 families provided a pool of inexpensive labor for nearby farmers. With declining agriculture, many of the men of the community were laborers, drivers, trash collectors and golf caddies for wealthy whites, while women such as Geneva Mason were seamstresses, cooks, maids and baby sitters for white families in the area. In 1927, the community was strengthened with the addition of a Rosenwald School. The community continued to suffer due to segregation and discrimination even as surrounding areas began a transition from farming communities into housing and other developments. While surrounding (almost entirely) white communities were built, Scotland remained without water, electricity, and had unpaved roads into the 1960s. In the mid-1960s, community efforts led to a 100 townhouse (75 rented, 25 privately owned) development and the institution of community self-governance which continues to this date. In 2014, the community center was renovated and in 2018 the 75 rental properties underwent a major renovation and upgrade.","African-American history of Montgomery County, Maryland | Unincorporated communities in Montgomery County, Maryland","1927, 2014, 2018",Background | Save Our Scotland | Not just about housing stock | Plans to Prosper You exhibit | Renaming streets for Scotland community leaders | 2023 Juneteenth Celebration | Second Century Project | References,,1892,2025-06-22 19:41:51

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake–Kendrick_Lamar_feud,Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud,Kendrick Lamar,"The Canadian rapper Drake and the American rapper Kendrick Lamar have been involved in a rap feud since 2013, when Drake responded to Lamar's verse on the Big Sean song ""Control"". It escalated in 2024 with Lamar's lyrics in the song ""Like That"". The two began on favorable terms in 2011. On August 14, 2013, Lamar dissed Drake, among many rappers, on ""Control"", but claimed his verse was ""friendly competition"". Over the next decade, the two denied speculation that they had dissed each other on various songs. In 2023, on rapper J. Cole and Drake's song ""First Person Shooter"", Cole claimed that he, Drake, and Lamar were the ""big three"" of modern hip-hop; on ""Like That"" in March 2024, Lamar rejected the notion of a big three, saying the top spot in hip hop was ""just big me"". In April 2024, Cole responded by dissing Lamar on ""7 Minute Drill"", then Drake dissed Lamar with ""Push Ups"" and ""Taylor Made Freestyle"". On April 30, Lamar responded to Drake in ""Euphoria"" and, on May 3, in ""6:16 in LA"". Later on May 3, Drake released ""Family Matters"", accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and claiming that Lamar's collaborator, music producer Dave Free, biologically fathered Lamar's son. Twenty minutes later, Lamar released ""Meet the Grahams"", accusing Drake of sexual predation (including sex trafficking), lying about Lamar's family, and having fathered a second secret child; rapper Pusha T had previously revealed in a 2018 track that Drake secretly had a son named Adonis. On May 4, on ""Not Like Us"", Lamar accused Drake of pedophilia. On May 5, Drake released ""The Heart Part 6"", which denied Lamar's accusations and claimed Drake's team fed Lamar false information about a second child. In January 2025, Drake filed a petition against and then sued Universal Music Group (UMG)—his and Lamar's record label— in the Southern District Court of New York, for releasing ""Not Like Us"", alleging that the song was defamatory and that it was promoted by UMG with illegal tactics. In 2025, Drake reflected on the feud on ""Fighting Irish Freestyle""; and Lamar won five Grammy Awards for ""Not Like Us"" (including Song of the Year), performing it and ""Euphoria"" at Super Bowl LIX.",2024 in American music | Hip-hop feuds | Drake (musician) | Kendrick Lamar | 2024 in Internet culture | Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud | 2024 controversies in the United States | African-American-related controversies,"2011, 2018, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2013","History | 2011–12: Initial collaboration and favorable relationship | 2013–14: ""Control"", ""The Language"", and first indirect confrontation | 2015–2022: Sneak disses | 2023–24: Direct confrontation | 2024–present: Aftermath of direct confrontation | Commentary | Celebrity and media reactions","Date: September 23, 2013[1][2][note 1] – present(11 years, 8 months, 4 weeks and 1 day)2024 escalation:March 22, 2024[1][2] – July 4, 2024[note 2](104 days) | Medium: Diss tracks | Status: Ongoing2024 escalation: Lamar victory,[note 3] see verdict.",2172,2025-06-22 19:36:43

GNX was released to widespread universal acclaim: multiple critics hailed it as a successful reimagination of West Coast hip-hop and one of the best albums of 2024; a few otherwise thought that the album was not as groundbreaking or too polished. The album was Lamar's fifth number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. It also topped the charts in numerous countries, including Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Denmark, and the UK; and top five in Poland, Nigeria, France, and Hungary.

The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization, producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry. The city-state of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between 2450 and 1450 BC, controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts, an area as large as Egypt. The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as ""Kush"" probably from the indigenous ethnonym ""Kasu"", over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare, trade, and cultural exchange. Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period (1550–1070 BC). Following Egypt's disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata (now modern Karima, Sudan). Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt, such as the veneration of Amun, and the royal families of both kingdoms occasionally intermarried, Kushite culture, language and ethnicity was distinct; Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress, appearance, and even method of transportation. In the 8th century BC, King Kashta (""the Kushite"") peacefully became King of Upper Egypt, while his daughter, Amenirdis, was appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun in Thebes. His successor Piye invaded Lower Egypt, establishing the Kushite-ruled Twenty-fifth Dynasty. Piye's daughter, Shepenupet II, was also appointed Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The monarchs of Kush ruled Egypt for over a century until the Assyrian conquest, being dethroned by the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal in the mid-seventh century BC. Following the severing of ties with Egypt, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Meroë, during which time it was known by the Greeks as Aethiopia. The northernmost part of Nubia was occupied from the third century BC to the third century AD, first by the Ptolemaic Kingdom and then by the Roman Empire. At the end of this 600-year period, the territory, known in the Greco-Roman world as Dodekaschoinos, was taken back by the Kushite king Yesebokheamani. The Kingdom of Kush persisted as a major regional power until the fourth century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated amid worse",Kingdom of Kush | States and territories disestablished in the 4th century | States and territories established in the 11th century BC | 350s disestablishments | Roman client kingdoms | Former kingdoms | Former empires,"1450, 1070, 1550",Name | History | Prelude | Formation (c. 1070–754 BC) | Rule over Egypt (754 BC–656 BC) | Napatan period (656 BC–c. 270 BC) | Meroitic period (c. 270 BC–4th century AD) | Language and writing,Status: Independent (780 BC – 330 AD)Under Aksumite rule (330 AD – 350 AD) | Capital: KermaNapataMeroë | Common languages: MeroiticEgyptian[4]Blemmyan[5]Old Nubian | Religion: Kushite religion[6]Ancient Egyptian religion | Demonym(s): Kushite,3279,2025-06-22 19:35:23
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_Kush,List of monarchs of Kush,Kingdom of Kush,"The monarchs of Kush were the rulers of the ancient Kingdom of Kush (8th century BCE – 4th century CE), a major civilization in ancient Nubia (roughly corresponding to modern-day Sudan). Kushite power was centralised and unified over the course of the centuries following the collapse of the New Kingdom of Egypt c. 1069 BCE, leading to the eventual establishment of the Kingdom of Kush under Alara c. 780 BCE. Kush reached the apex of its power c. 739–656 BCE, when the Kushite kings also ruled as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. The kingdom remained a powerful state in its heartland after Kushite rule in Egypt was terminated and it survived for another millennium until its collapse c. 350 CE. Egyptian culture heavily influenced Kush in terms of its royal and monumental iconography, though indigenous elements were also used and became increasingly prominent in the Meroitic period (c. 270 BCE–350 CE). There are no preserved Kushite lists of rulers and the regnal sequence is instead largely reconstructed based on evidence such as royal inscriptions and burials. Surviving sources are at several points scant, meaning that parts of the chronology and sequence are approximate and tentative. The list of rulers might also be incomplete given that future discoveries of additional royal names and burials are possible. The system of royal succession in the Kingdom of Kush is not well understood. There are no known administrative documents or histories written by the Kushites themselves; because very little of the royal genealogy can be reliably reconstructed, it is impossible to determine how the system functioned in theory and when or if it was ever broken. Royal women were prominent in Kushite society, especially in the Meroitic period (c. 270 BCE–350 CE). As a consequence it has long been disputed whether the Kushite succession was mainly patrilineal (inherited through male lines) or matrilineal (inherited through female lines). Further uncertainties would exist within either system; a patrilineal system can for instance be based around successions that are mainly father→son or mainly brother→brother. No ruling Kushite queens are known from before the Meroitic period, suggesting that they may have been excluded from holding office during earlier periods. Despite this, there are numerous royal inscriptions from pre-Meroitic kings, for instance Aspelta, that place emphasis only on their female ancestors. This is on its own generally not considered sufficient evidence ",Queens of Kush | Kings of Kush | Lists of monarchs in Africa | Ancient Egypt-related lists,"1550, 1069",Introduction | Royal succession in Kush | List format and content | List of monarchs | Early Napatan period (1069–780 BCE) | Middle Napatan period (780–656 BCE) | Late Napatan period (656–270 BCE) | Meroitic period (270 BCE–350 CE),,3421,2025-06-22 19:35:25

It borders the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, Libya to the northwest, Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the east, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the southeast, and South Sudan to the south. Sudan has a population of 50 million people as of 2024 and occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres (728,215 square miles), making it Africa's third-largest country by area and the third-largest by area in the Arab League. It was the largest country by area in Africa and the Arab League until the secession of South Sudan in 2011; since then both titles have been held by Algeria. Sudan's capital and most populous city is Khartoum. The area that is now Sudan witnessed the Khormusan (c. 40000–16000 BC), Halfan culture (c. 20500–17000 BC), Sebilian (c. 13000–10000 BC), Qadan culture (c. 15000–5000 BC),[citation needed] the war of Jebel Sahaba, the earliest known war in the world, around 11500 BC, A-Group culture (c. 3800–3100 BC), Kingdom of Kerma (c. 2500–1500 BC), the Egyptian New Kingdom (c. 1500–1070 BC), and the Kingdom of Kush (c. 785 BC – 350 AD). After the fall of Kush, the Nubians formed the three Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, most of Sudan was gradually settled by Arab nomads. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the Funj sultanate, while Darfur ruled the west and the Ottomans the east. In 1811, Mamluks established a state at Dunqulah as a base for their slave trading. Under Turco-Egyptian rule of Sudan after the 1820s, the practice of trading slaves was entrenched along a north–south axis, with slave raids taking place in southern parts of the country and slaves being transported to Egypt and the Ottoman Empire. From the 19th century, the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the Egyptians under the Muhammad Ali dynasty. Religious-nationalist fervour erupted in the Mahdist Uprising in which Mahdist forces were eventually defeated by a joint Egyptian-British military force. In 1899, under British pressure, Egypt agreed to share sovereignty over Sudan with the United Kingdom as a condominium. In effect, Sudan was governed as a British possession.",Sudan | 1956 establishments in Africa | Countries and territories where Arabic is an official language | Countries and territories where English is an official language | Countries in Africa | North African countries | Federal republics | Least developed countries,"1899, 2011, 1811, 1070, 1500, 2024",Etymology | History | Prehistoric Sudan (before c. 8000 BC) | Kerma culture (2500–1500 BC) | Egyptian Nubia (1504–1070 BC) | Kingdom of Kush (c. 1070 BC–350 AD) | Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350–1500) | Islamic kingdoms of Sennar and Darfur (c. 1500–1821),Capitaland largest city: Khartoum | Official languages: ArabicEnglish | Ethnic groups: 70% Sudanese Arab[1]5.9% Beja[2]2.5% Nuba[3]2% Fur[4]2% Egyptian[5]1.3% Nubian[a]16.3% others[11],2278,2025-06-22 19:35:27

Emerging from the earlier Dʿmt civilization, the kingdom was founded in the first century. The city of Axum served as the kingdom's capital for many centuries until it relocated to Kubar in the ninth century due to declining trade connections and recurring invasions. The Kingdom of Aksum was considered one of the four great powers of the third century by the Persian prophet Mani, alongside Persia, Rome, and China. Aksum continued to expand under the reign of Gedara (c. 200–230), who was the first king to be involved in South Arabian affairs. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihama, Najran, al-Ma'afir, Zafar (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands until a joint Himyarite-Sabean alliance pushed them out. Aksum-Himyar conflicts persisted throughout the third century. During the reign of Endubis (270–310), Aksum began minting coins that have been excavated as far away as Caesarea and southern India. As the kingdom became a major power on the trade route between Rome and India and gained a monopoly of Indian Ocean trade, it entered the Greco-Roman cultural sphere. Due to its ties with the Greco-Roman world, Aksum adopted Christianity as its state religion in the mid-fourth century under Ezana (320s – c. 360). Following their Christianization, the Aksumites ceased construction of steles. The kingdom continued to expand throughout late antiquity, conquering Kush under Ezana in 330 for a short period of time and inheriting from it the Greek exonym ""Ethiopia"". Aksumite dominance in the Red Sea culminated during the reign of Kaleb of Axum (514–542), who, at the behest of the Byzantine emperor Justin I, invaded the Himyarite Kingdom in Yemen in order to end the persecution of Christians perpetrated by the Jewish king Dhu Nuwas. With the annexation of Himyar, the Kingdom of Aksum reached its largest territorial extent, spanning around 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). However, the territory was lost in the Aksumite–Persian wars. Aksum held on to Southern Arabia from 520 until 525 when Sumyafa Ashwa was deposed by Abraha.",Kingdom of Aksum | Former empires in Africa | Former monarchies of Africa | Political history of Eritrea | Countries in ancient Africa | Countries in medieval Africa | States and territories established in the 1st century | States and territories disestablished in the 960s,,Etymology | History | Early history | Rise of Aksum | Decline | Society | Culture | Language,"Capital: Axum

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cush_(Bible),Cush (Bible),Kingdom of Kush,"Cush or Kush (/kʊʃ, kʌʃ/ Hebrew: כּוּשׁ Kūš; Ge'ez: ኩሽ), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the oldest son of Ham and a grandson of Noah. He was the brother of Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. Cush was the father of Nimrod. Cush is traditionally considered the ancestor of the ""Land of Cush"", an ancient territory believed to have been located near the Red Sea. Cush is identified in the Bible with the Kingdom of Kush or ancient Aethiopia. The Cushitic languages are named after Cush. Cush is a Hebrew name that is possibly derived from Kash, the Egyptian name of Upper Nubia and later of the Nubian kingdom at Napata, known as the Kingdom of Kush. Alternatively the biblical name may be a mistranslation of the Mesopotamian city of Kish. The form Kush appears in Egyptian records as early as the reign of Mentuhotep II (21st century BC), in an inscription detailing his campaigns against the Nubian region. At the time of the compilation of the Hebrew Bible, and throughout classical antiquity, the Nubian kingdom was centered at Meroë in the modern-day nation of Sudan. Biblical scholar Kevin Burrell argues that Cush in the Table of Nations should be identified with Meluhha, a placename originally referring to a region east of Mesopotamia but which starting from the mid-2nd millennium BC onwards became equated with the territory of Kush in Nubia. According to Burrell, this explains both Cush's Mesopotamian connections in the biblical narrative through his son Nimrod and the fact that his name derives from a Nubian kingdom.",Hebrew Bible nations | Kingdom of Kush | Children of Ham (son of Noah) | Noach (parashah) | Nimrod | Book of Genesis people | Books of Chronicles people | Zipporah,,Identification | References in Bible | Traditional identifications | References,"Children: Nimrod, Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Sabtechah | Parent: Ham  (father)",1528,2025-06-22 19:35:28

He served as Prime Minister of the Gold Coast from 1952 until 1957, when it gained independence from Britain. He was then the first Prime Minister and then the President of Ghana, from 1957 until 1966. An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962. After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed the Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained the position when he led Ghana to achieve independence from Britain in 1957, a first in sub-saharan Africa at the time. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah as president. His administration was primarily socialist as well as nationalist. It funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations and the pan-africanist movement during Africa's decolonization period. After multiple failed attempts on his life, coupled with increasingly difficult local economic conditions, Nkrumah's government became authoritarian in the 1960s, as he repressed political opposition and conducted elections that were neither free nor fair. In 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. He fostered a personality cult, forming ideological institutes and adopting the title of 'Osagyefo Dr.' Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 in a coup d'état by the National Liberation Council. Claims of CIA involvement in his overthrow have never been verified. Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, where he was named honorary co-president.",Kwame Nkrumah | 1909 births | 1972 deaths | African revolutionaries | Chairpersons of the African Union | Alumni of Achimota School | Alumni of the London School of Economics | Anti-imperialists,"1972, 1962, 1960, 1966, 1909, 1957, 1952",Early life and education | Gold Coast | United States | London | Return to the Gold Coast | United Gold Coast Convention | Convention People's Party | Leader of Government Business and Prime Minister,Preceded by: Office established | Succeeded by: Joseph Arthur Ankrah as Chairman of the NLC,2236,2025-06-22 19:39:36

Over the years, the park has attracted visitors from around the world, with an annual count of approximately 98,000 individuals who visit to pay homage to Ghana's first President, and learn about his life and legacy. As one of the top 10 most visited sites in the country, the park holds immense cultural and historical significance. The mausoleum, originally designed by Dr. E. G. A. Don Arthur, is the centerpiece of the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park and houses the final remains of the first President and his wife, Fathia Nkrumah. The Mausoleum is dedicated to the prominent Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah. The memorial complex was dedicated in 1992, and is situated on the site of the former British colonial polo grounds in Accra. It is five acres in size. It is the spot where Nkrumah made the declaration of Ghana's independence. On the premises is a museum that has on display objects from various stages of his life. The building is meant to represent an upside down sword, which in Akan culture is a symbol of peace. The mausoleum is clad from top to bottom with Italian marble, with a black star at its apex to symbolize unity. The interior boasts marble flooring and a mini mastaba looking marble grave marker, surrounded by river-washed rocks. A skylight at the top in the mausoleum illuminates the grave. The mausoleum is surrounded by water, a symbol of life. Nkrumah's political journey began after twelve years abroad, where he pursued higher education and refined his political philosophy. On his return to the Gold Coast, he established the Convention People's Party, quickly winning over the masses with his promise of national independence. Nkrumah's vision came to fruition in 1957 when the Gold Coast declared independence from Britain, and in 1960, Ghanaians elected Nkrumah as their president under a new constitution.",Buildings and structures in Accra | Monuments and memorials in Ghana | Kwame Nkrumah | Government buildings in Ghana | 1992 establishments in Ghana | Tourism in Ghana,"1992, 1957, 1960",History | Dissolution | Face lift | New Features | References | External links,"Established: 1 July 1992 (1992-07-01) | Dissolved: The Museum was shut down for one year for renovations and was opened to the public on the 4th of July 2023.

Fathia Nkrumah was born to a Coptic Christian family and brought up in Zeitoun, a district of Cairo. She was the first child of a civil servant who died early; Fathia was raised by her mother single-handedly after her husband's death. She was born Fathia Halim Rizk in Zeitoun, Cairo, in 1932.

After completing her secondary education, where she studied French, she worked as a teacher at her school in Zeitoun, Notre Dame des Apôtres. As teaching did not appeal to her, she took a job in a bank.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwanzaa,Kwanzaa,Kwanzaa holiday,"Kwanzaa (/ˈkwɑːnzə/) is an annual celebration of African-American culture from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a communal feast called Karamu, usually on the sixth day. It was created by activist Maulana Karenga based on African harvest festival traditions from various parts of West, East, as well as Southeast Africa. Kwanzaa was first celebrated in 1966. Twenty-first-century estimates place the number of Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa between 500,000 and 2,000,000. American black separatist Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 during the aftermath of the Watts riots as a non-Christian, specifically African-American holiday. Karenga said his goal was to ""give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give black people an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."" For Karenga, a figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored the essential premise that ""you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction."": 63–65 According to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning ""first fruits"". First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa and are celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice. Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama.: 84 It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional ""a"" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.: 228 During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a ""White"" religion that Black people should shun. As Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, stating in the 1997 book Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture that ""Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.""

The federal government does not require private businesses to close or offer paid time off, as is the case for most state and local governments, so employers determine which holidays to observe. Several federal holidays are widely observed by private businesses with paid time off. These include New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Businesses often close or grant paid time off for New Year's Eve, Christmas Eve, and the Day after Thanksgiving, but none of these are federal holidays. Other federal holidays are less widely observed by businesses. Most federal holidays are celebrated on a Monday or Friday to create a three-day weekend.

She received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Show Host in 2012 for her work and her show. As the partner of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, she served as the de facto first lady of New York from 2011 to 2019, when the couple ended their relationship. Lee was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1966, the daughter of Vicky Svitak and Wayne Waldroop, who had been high-school sweethearts. When Sandra was two, her mother sent her, along with her younger sister, Cindy, to live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine Waldroop. In 1972, after divorcing Wayne, Lee's mother moved with her girls to Sumner, Washington, where they acquired a new stepfather, whose last name (Christiansen) Lee took. Vicky had three additional children in the 1970s: Kimber, Richie, and John Paul. Due to her mother's illness and the absence of her and her siblings' fathers, Lee effectively raised her four younger siblings.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season,Christmas and holiday season,Kwanzaa holiday,"The Christmas season or the festive season, also known as the holiday season or the holidays, is an annual period generally spanning from November or December to early January. Incorporating Christmas Day and New Year's Day, the various celebrations during this time create a peak season for the retail sector (Christmas/holiday ""shopping season"") extending to the end of the period (""January sales""). Christmas window displays and Christmas tree lighting ceremonies are customary traditions in various locales. In Western Christianity, the Christmas season is traditionally synonymous with Christmastide, which runs from December 25 (Christmas Day) to January 5 (Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve), popularly known as the 12 Days of Christmas. Christmas in Italy is one of the country's major holidays and begins on 8 December, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany. As the economic impact involving the anticipatory lead-up to Christmas Day grew in America and Europe into the 19th and 20th centuries, the term ""Christmas season"" began to also encompass the liturgical Advent season, the period of preparation observed in Western Christianity from the fourth Sunday before Christmas Day until the night of Christmas Eve. The term ""Advent calendar"" continues to be widely known in Western parlance as a term referring to a countdown to Christmas Day from the beginning of December. Beginning in the mid-20th century, as the Christian-associated Christmas holiday and liturgical season, in some circles, became increasingly commercialized and central to American economics and culture while religio-multicultural sensitivity rose, generic references to the season that omitted the word ""Christmas"" became more common in the corporate and public sphere of the United States, which has caused a semantics controversy. By the late 20th century, the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and the new African American cultural holiday of Kwanzaa began to be considered in the U.S. as being part of the ""holiday season"", a term that as of 2013 had become equally or more prevalent than ""Christmas season"" in U.S. sources to refer to the end-of-the-year festive period.

Karenga was imprisoned in California Men's Colony until he received parole in 1975. In 1966, Karenga notably created Kwanzaa, modeling the holiday after the African ""first fruit"" traditions. The rituals of the holiday promote African traditions, including the ""seven principles of African heritage"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lagos,History of Lagos,Lagos Nigeria history,"Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, and its former capital; it is the largest city in Africa in terms of population, with about 15.3 million people. It is also the 4th largest economy in Africa. Founded in the 16th century by the Awori people as Eko, it was for centuries a small but important commercial kingdom on the Bight of Benin. In 1851, the British intervened in an internal political dispute, establishing their influence. It formally became a protectorate in 1861. The core of modern-day Lagos, Lagos Island was originally known as 'Oko' to the native Awori, a sub-group of the Yoruba people, and later as 'Eko' when it was under the administration of the Benin Kingdom. This name came from Ikurame, meaning 'war camp' in the Edo language. The Portuguese would refer to it as ""Onim"" and later ""Lagos"". To differentiate the modern settlement from the older kingdom in the area, the name ""Onim"" has been applied to the latter by some historians such as Toby Green. Lagos means ""lakes"" in Portuguese. Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo, which means Lake of Curamo. It's also probable that the city was named after the homonymous coastal town of Lagos, Portugal, in the Algarve region, where sailors and settlers would have departed.[better source needed] Lagos was originally inhabited by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people. Awori legend has it that their ruler Olofin was given a mud plate by Oduduwa, with the instructions to place it in the river and settler wherever it sank to the bottom. After drifting down the river, it eventually sank in Lagos lagoon. Olofin divided the island among his ten sons. One of them, Aromire, planted pepper on the nearby island of Lagos. The palace of the Oba (king) of the Yoruba, Iga Idunganran, which was later built on this site, is therefore literally translated as ""pepper farm palace"".",History of Lagos,"1472, 1861, 1851",Historical names | Beginnings | Foundation Legend | Early History | Under Benin | Commercial Growth and Political Instability | Major Slaving Port | Succession Disputes,,1917,2025-06-22 19:36:06
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos,Lagos,Lagos Nigeria history,"Lagos (/ˈleɪɡɒs/ LAY-goss; Yoruba: Èkó), or Lagos City, is a large metropolitan city in southwestern Nigeria. With an upper population estimated above 21 million dwellers, it is the largest city in Nigeria, the most populous urban area on the African continent, and one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until the government's December 1991 decision to move their capital to Abuja, in the centre of the country. Lagos is a major African financial centre and is the economic hub of Lagos State and Nigeria at large. The city has a significant influence on commerce, entertainment, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, and fashion in Africa. Lagos is also among the top ten of the world's fastest-growing cities and urban areas. In 2024, Time Out magazine ranked Lagos as the 19th best city to visit in the world. A megacity, it has the second-highest GDP in Africa, and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity. Lagos emerged as a home to the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba of West Africa in the 15th century, which are contained in the present-day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. Before the 15th century, the Awori settled on a Farmstead along the coastal line in and around which they worked and lived. The Farmstead translates to Ereko in Yoruba, from which comes the Lagos indigenous name ""Eko"". The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the original city of Lagos, and the Mainland, which it has since expanded into. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State, in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present-day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State,Lagos State,Lagos Nigeria history,"Lagos State (Yoruba: Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkó, Gun: Ayìmátẹ̀n Awọnlìn tọ̀n) is a state in South West, Nigeria. Of the 36 Nigerian states, Lagos is the second most populous state but the smallest in terms of land mass. Bounded to the south by the Bight of Benin and to the west by the international border with Benin for 10 km, Lagos State borders Ogun State to the north for about 283 km, making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named for the city of Lagos—the most populous city in Africa—the state was formed from the Western Region and the former Federal Capital Territory on 27 May 1967. Geographically, Lagos State is dominated by bodies of water with nearly a quarter of the state's area covered with bodies of water. The largest of these bodies are the Lagos and Lekki lagoons in the state's interior with the Ogun and Osun rivers flowing into them. Many other rivers and creeks flow throughout the state and serve as vital means of transportation for people and goods. On land, non-urbanized areas are within the tropical Nigerian lowland forests ecoregion with natural areas containing threatened populations of mona monkey, tree pangolin, and hooded vulture along with a transitory population of African forest elephants. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are large fish populations along with African manatees and crocodiles. Lagos State has been inhabited for years by various indigenous ethnic groups, primarily the majority Yoruba people who live throughout the state but also the Ewe and Ogu peoples in the far west. As a result of migration since the nineteenth century, Lagos State also has large populations of non-native Nigerian ethnic groups with Edo, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, Ijaw, Ibibio, Efik, and Nupe peoples among other Nigerian groups. There are also groups from outside of Nigeria's modern borders with the Saro (Sierra Leonean) and Amaro (Brazilian) groups being descendants of formerly enslaved people who returned to Africa in the 1800s with a longstanding Middle Eastern Nigerian community (mainly Syrian and Lebanese Nigerians) also forming a significant part of Lagos' population along with recent immigrants from Benin, China, Ghana, India, Togo, and the United Kingdom.

It was the capital of Lagos State until 1957. It is part of the Lagos Division. As of the preliminary 2006 Nigerian census, the LGA had a population of 209,437 within an area of just 8.7 km2. The LGA only covers the western half of Lagos Island; the eastern half is simply referred to as Lagos Island East LCDA. Lying on Lagos Lagoon, a large protected harbour on the coast of Africa, the island is home to the Yoruba fishing village of Eko, which grew into the modern city of Lagos. The city has now spread out to cover the neighboring islands as well as the adjoining mainland. Lagos Island is connected to the mainland by three large bridges (the Carter Bridge, the Eko Bridge and the Third Mainland Bridge) which cross Lagos Lagoon to the district of Ebute Metta. It is also linked to the neighboring island of Ikoyi and to Victoria Island. The Lagos harbor district of Apapa faces the western side of the island. Forming the main commercial district of Lagos, Lagos Island plays host to the main government buildings, shops and offices. The Catholic and Anglican Cathedrals, as well as the Central Mosque, are located here. Historically, Lagos Island (Isale Eko) was home to the Brazilian Quarter of Lagos where the majority of the slave trade returnees from Brazil stayed.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X,Malcolm X,Malcolm X,"Malcolm X (born Malcolm Little, later el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965) was an African American revolutionary, Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement until his assassination in 1965. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam (NOI) until 1964, after which he left the movement, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the African American community. He is also a celebrated figure within African American and Muslim communities for his pursuit of racial justice. Malcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes and with various relatives, after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to eight to ten years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison, he joined the Nation of Islam, adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding ""the white slavemaster name of 'Little'"", and after his parole in 1952, he quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, as well as criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on non-violence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca and became known as ""el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz"", which roughly translates to ""The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch"". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences. In 2021, two of the convictions were vacated.

Three members of the Nation of Islam—Muhammad Abdul Aziz, Khalil Islam, and Thomas Hagan—were charged, tried, and convicted of the murder and given indeterminate life sentences, but in November 2021, Aziz and Islam were exonerated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or by law enforcement agencies, particularly the FBI and CIA, has persisted for decades after the shooting. The assassination was one of four major assassinations of the 1960s in the United States, coming less than two years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, and three years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. Throughout 1964, Malcolm X's conflict with the Nation of Islam (NOI) intensified, and he was repeatedly threatened. Malcolm X fell out with the NOI and the group's leader, Elijah Muhammad, after Malcolm X made provocative remarks about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and condemned Muhammad's sexual relationships with several underage girls. Malcolm X publicly announced his departure from the NOI in March 1964. In February, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of Malcolm X's car. In March, Elijah Muhammad told Boston minister Louis X (later known as Louis Farrakhan) that ""hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off""; the April 10 edition of Muhammad Speaks featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm X's bouncing, severed head.",Assassination of Malcolm X | Assassinations in the United States | 1965 murders in the United States | February 1965 in the United States | 1965 in New York City | African-American history in New York City | Crimes adapted into films | Death conspiracy theories,"1965, 1963, 1968, 1964, 2021",Death threats and intimidation from Nation of Islam | Assassination | Funeral | Reactions | Allegations of conspiracy | Lawsuit in federal district court | Portrayals in popular culture | See also,"Location: Manhattan, New York City, U.S. | Date: February 21, 1965; 60 years ago (1965-02-21) 3:15 p.m. (EST) | Target: Malcolm X | Attack type: Assassination, murder by shooting | Weapons: Sawed-off shotgun2 semi-automatic pistols | Victim: Malcolm X, aged 39",1883,2025-06-22 19:38:15

Directed and co-written by Spike Lee, the film stars Denzel Washington in the title role, alongside Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Lee has a supporting role, while Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South African president Nelson Mandela make cameo appearances. The film marked the second collaboration for Lee and Washington, succeeding Mo' Better Blues (1990). The screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley's 1965 book The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Haley had collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination in 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks. Malcolm X was distributed by Warner Bros. and released in the United States on November 18, 1992. The same year, Denzel Washington won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance. At the 65th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for two Oscars including the Best Actor for Washington and Best Costume Design for Ruth E. Carter. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X,The Autobiography of Malcolm X,Malcolm X,"The Autobiography of Malcolm X is an autobiography written by Muslim American minister and activist Malcolm X in collaboration with American journalist Alex Haley. It was released posthumously on October 29, 1965, nine months after his assassination. Haley coauthored the book based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and 1965. The Autobiography is a religious conversion narrative which outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of Black pride, Black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After he was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue,[a] which describes their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm's life. While Malcolm X and scholars contemporary to its publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator who intentionally muted his authorial voice in order to create the effect of Malcolm X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm X's stylistic choices. For example, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation, which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of ""suspense and drama"". According to biographer Manning Marable, ""Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism"" and rewrote material to eliminate it. When the Autobiography was published, The New York Times reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith described it as a ""brilliant, painful, important book"". In 1967, historian John William Ward wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, Time named The Autobiography of Malcolm X as one of ten ""required reading"" nonfiction books. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl adapted the book as a screenplay, which later provided the source material for Spike Lee's 1992 film Malcolm X. Published posthumously, The Autobiography of Malcolm X is an account of the life of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood first in Omaha, Nebraska and then in the area around Lansing and Mason, Michigan, the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Jacques_Garvey,Amy Jacques Garvey,Marcus Garvey Jamaica,"Amy Euphemia Jacques Garvey (31 December 1895 – 25 July 1973) was a Jamaican-born journalist and activist. She was the second wife of Marcus Garvey. She was one of the pioneering female Black journalists and publishers of the 20th century. Amy Euphemia Jacques was born on 31 December 1895 in Kingston, Jamaica. As the eldest child of George Samuel and Charlotte Henrietta, she was raised in a middle-class home. Yvette Taylor, in her account of the life of Amy Jacques Garvey, refers to her as being ""mulatta"". Charlotte Henrietta was biracial, and George Samuel was a dark-skinned Black man. Taylor goes on to explain that Garvey's mixed race heavily influenced her upbringing. At a young age, Garvey was taught to play the piano and took courses in music appreciation because music and music appreciation were believed to be considered the ""cultural finishing to a girl's education"". Garvey was a part of a small minority of Jamaican youth to attend high school. She attended Wolmer's Schools. Amy Jacques Garvey was urged by her father to read periodicals and newspapers to ""enhance"" her knowledge of the world. Upon graduating school and receiving some of the highest honors of the time, Garvey was recruited to work at a law firm. Her father initially said no, refusing to allow his daughter to work in an environment with males. George Samuel died that year, and the lawyer proceeding over his estate urged Charlotte Henrietta to allow Garvey to work in the clerical office so that she could control the estate. Charlotte agreed, and Garvey worked there for four years, where she ultimately gained knowledge of the legal system. After four years of working for this company, Garvey migrated to the United States in 1917. She promised her employer and mother that she would return in three months if conditions in the U.S. were not suitable to her; however, Garvey did not return. Karen Adler, in her article chronicling Garvey's life, argues that she did not return because she was enthralled by Garveyism.","1895 births | 1973 deaths | People from Kingston, Jamaica | Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League members | Jamaican pan-Africanists | African-American writers | Jamaican women journalists | Jamaican women writers","1895, 1973, 1917",Early life and education | Marriage and family | Leadership of UNIA | Life after UNIA | Works | Death | References | External links,"Born: Amy Euphemia Jacques(1895-12-31)31 December 1895Kingston, Jamaica | Died: 25 July 1973(1973-07-25) (aged 77)Kingston, Jamaica | Other names: AJ Garvey | Occupation(s): Publisher, journalist | Known for: Activism, black nationalism, Pan-Africanism | Spouse: Marcus Garvey (1922–1940)",2013,2025-06-22 19:34:43

She was a director of the Black Star Line Steamship Corporation, and along with her former husband Marcus Garvey she founded the Negro World newspaper. Amy Ashwood was born in Port Antonio, Jamaica, on 10 January 1897, the only daughter of the three children of businessman Michael Delbert Ashwood and his wife, Maudriana Thompson. As a child, Amy was told by her grandmother that she was of Ashanti descent. She was also of Indian descent. Taken to Panama as an infant, she returned in 1904 to Jamaica, and attended the Westwood High School for Girls in Trelawny, where she met Marcus Garvey, with whom she founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1914. The UNIA was the most influential anti-colonial organization in Jamaica up until 1938. Its legacy lies in giving women an opportunity to be leaders and influence in the public sphere. At the age of 17, while in UNIA, Amy Ashwood wrote romantic letters to Marcus, in which she said: ""Our joint love for Africa and our concern for the welfare of our race urged us to immediate action."" She organized a women's section of the UNIA, and in 1918, she moved to the United States, where she worked as Garvey's aide and as Secretary of the UNIA's New York City branch. In 1919, she was made secretary of the Black Star Line and became one of its first directors. She met Marcus Garvey in 1914 and they married on 25 December 1919, but the marriage quickly broke down (there were accusations of infidelity on both sides), ending in divorce in 1922. There followed lawsuits and counter-suits for annulment, divorce, alimony and bigamy. Garvey divorced Ashwood in Missouri in 1922 and quickly married Amy Jacques, Ashwood's former roommate and maid of honour. Marcus Garvey accused Ashwood of theft, alcoholism and laziness. Amy Ashwood reportedly never accepted the divorce and contended to the end of her days that she was the ""real"" Mrs. Garvey. Amy continued her work as a pan-Africanist, politician, and cultural feminist in the US, Jamaica and England throughout the rest of her life. Ashwood arrived in London 1932 and continued her endeavors as a Pan-African heroine. Decades earlier, in 1914, Ashwood assisted her husband Marcus Garvey with founding the Negro World, its purpose being to connect African-American people across continents, and founded a popular local night club.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey,Marcus Garvey,Marcus Garvey Jamaica,"Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. ONH (17 August 1887 – 10 June 1940) was a Jamaican political activist. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) (commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Garvey was ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist. His ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born into a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay and was apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism. He later lived briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. On returning to Jamaica, he founded the UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule in Africa and advocated the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that part of the diaspora should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular, and the UNIA grew in membership. His black separatist views—and his relationship with white racists like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the interest of advancing their shared goal of racial separatism—caused a division between Garvey and other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who promoted racial integration. Believing that black people needed to be financially independent from white-dominated societies, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negro World newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia. In 1923 Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock, and was imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta for nearly two years. Garvey blamed Jews and Catholics, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the KKK. His sentence was commuted by U.S. president Calvin Coolidge and he was deported to Jamaica in 1927.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Garvey_(album),Marcus Garvey (album),Marcus Garvey Jamaica,"Marcus Garvey is the third album by reggae artist Burning Spear, released in 1975 on Fox Records in Jamaica and then internationally on Island Records later in the year. The album is named after the Jamaican National Hero and Rastafari movement prophet Marcus Garvey. A dub version of it was released four months later as Garvey's Ghost. This was the first album by Burning Spear recorded for producer Lawrence Lindo, better known by his handle taken from the assassin of Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby. Apparently, Lindo and Burning Spear realized the opening track to this album, ""Marcus Garvey"", on their first meeting. Island Records, whose founder Chris Blackwell had been instrumental in breaking Jamaican reggae artists Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, and Bob Marley to an international audience, then made a deal to release it internationally, but believed the original Jamaican mix of the album to be too threatening, or at least too commercially unviable, for white audiences and therefore remixed it into what they considered a more palatable form, outraging him. The Jamaican release also does not include the final track, ""Resting Place"", which had only been issued as a single there. The backing musicians, whom Lindo named the Black Disciples, had been assembled from the Soul Syndicate and the Wailers. On July 27, 2010, this album was remastered and released by Universal's Hip-O Records reissue imprint in tandem with the dub version on one compact disc.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.,Martin Luther King Jr.,Martin Luther King Jr,"Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist and political philosopher who was a leader of the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. He advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. A Black church leader, King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. There were dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who often responded violently. King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of COINTELPRO from 1963. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide. King won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day,Martin Luther King Jr. Day,Martin Luther King Jr,"Martin Luther King Jr. Day (officially Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., and often referred to shorthand as MLK Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed on the third Monday of January each year. King was the chief spokesperson for nonviolent activism in the Civil Rights Movement, which protested racial discrimination in federal and state law and civil society. The movement led to several groundbreaking legislative reforms in the United States. Born in 1929, Martin Luther King Jr.'s actual birthday is January 15 (which in 1929 fell on a Tuesday). The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21. The Monday observance is similar for those federal holidays which fall under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968. President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later on January 20, 1986. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. Official observance in each state's law as well as federal law occurred in 2000. The initial idea of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by labor unions in contract negotiations. After King's death, Representative John Conyers (a Democrat from Michigan) and Senator Edward Brooke (a Republican from Massachusetts) introduced a bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national/official holiday. The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979. It fell five votes short of the number needed for passage. Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition (King had never held public office). Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them: George Washington and Christopher Columbus.",1983 establishments in the United States | Memorials to Martin Luther King Jr. | Public holidays in the United States | Federal holidays in the United States | United States flag flying days | January observances | Monday observances | Coretta Scott King,"1983, 1979, 1929, 1968, 2000, 1986",History | Proposals | Federal passage | State passage | Alternative names | Observance | Workplace leave | National Day of Service,"Official name: Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. | Also called: MLK Day, King Day, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day | Type: Federal | Date: Third Monday in January | 2024 date: January 15    (2024-01-15) | 2025 date: January 20    (2025-01-20)",2018,2025-06-22 19:38:09

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_III,Martin Luther King III,Martin Luther King Jr,"Martin Luther King III (born October 23, 1957) is an American human rights activist, philanthropist, and an advocate. The second child and eldest son of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, he served as the fourth president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference from 1997 to 2004. As of 2024, he is a professor of practice at the University of Virginia. Martin Luther King III was born on October 23, 1957, at St. Jude's Hospital in Montgomery, Alabama to civil rights advocates Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. His mother had reservations about naming him after his famous father, ""realizing the burdens it can create for the child,"" but King Jr. always wanted to name his son Martin Luther III. King's birth occurred as his father was speaking to members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and he announced his son's name after being told of the birth. King's birth caused much of his mother's time to be taken away from her artistry and she spent the remainder of his birth year caring for him and his older sister Yolanda. Martin Luther King III has three siblings: Yolanda, Dexter, and Bernice. They were raised in Vine City, an urban neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was eight years old and only in the third grade, he began to endure racial comments and insults from a white boy in his class, who also happened to like to draw. When he approached the boy and complimented him on a drawing of his, the harassment ceased. King was ten years old when his father was assassinated. Years prior to his father's death, Harry Belafonte set up a trust fund for King and his siblings. King attended Spring Street Elementary School but transferred to The Galloway School following his father's assassination. King received his B.A. degree in political science from Morehouse College in 1979, the same school where his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather attended. King is a fraternity brother/member of Alpha Phi Alpha, as was his father.

He helped shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of successes, which earned him the nicknames ""Prince of Motown"" and ""Prince of Soul"", and is often considered one of the greatest singers of all time. Gaye's Motown hits include ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)"" (1964), ""Ain't That Peculiar"" (1965), and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" (1968). He also recorded duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross. During the 1970s, Gaye became one of the first Motown artists to break away from the reins of a production company and recorded the landmark albums What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get It On (1973). His later recordings influenced several R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. ""Sexual Healing"", released in 1982 on the album Midnight Love, won him his first two Grammy Awards. Gaye's last televised appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever in 1983, and on Soul Train. On April 1, 1984, Gaye intervened during a fight between his parents at their home in Western Heights, Los Angeles. Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., subsequently shot and killed Gaye; it was the eve of his 45th birthday. Gay Sr. later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, receiving a six-year suspended sentence and five years of probation.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Marvin_Gaye,Killing of Marvin Gaye,Marvin Gaye,"On April 1, 1984, American musician Marvin Gaye, who gained worldwide fame for his work with Motown Records, was shot and killed on the day before his 45th birthday by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., at their house in the Western Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Gaye was shot twice following an altercation with his father, after he intervened in an argument between his parents. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the California Hospital Medical Center. His father later pleaded no contest to a charge of voluntary manslaughter. Gaye's death by filicide inspired several musical tributes over the years, including recollections of the incidents leading to his death. He was given a burial plot at Forest Lawn Cemetery, but was later cremated; his ashes were spread around the Pacific Ocean. Marvin Gaye had a bitter relationship with his father, Marvin Gay Sr., since his childhood. Marvin Sr. was a Christian minister and strict disciplinarian who often physically punished his children. He was also a cross-dresser, a fact widely known in the family's Washington, D.C., neighborhood which made the younger Marvin a target of bullying. Due to this ""sexual ambiguity"" on the part of his father, as well as rumors of Gaye's own homosexuality (and in tribute to one of Gaye's favorite singers, Sam Cooke), the younger Marvin added an ""e"" to his last name when he became famous. Gaye's father never approved of his son's career in music, and gradually grew resentful that Gaye was closer to his mother, Alberta, and had become the breadwinner for the family.[citation needed] Despite a brief improvement in their relationship after Gaye found success with his album What's Going On, father and son never found any lasting peace. By 1983, after a period as a European tax exile, Gaye had re-entered the public eye with the hit song ""Sexual Healing"" and its album, Midnight Love. For a time, he had also achieved sobriety during his extensive stay in Belgium. Returning to the U.S., he embarked on what would be his final concert tour, titled the Sexual Healing Tour, in San Diego, California, at Humphreys on April 18, 1983. Gaye, who had a profound dislike for touring, returned to cocaine abuse to cope with the pressures of the road, and, midway through the tour, he developed paranoia over an alleged attempt on his life, wearing a bulletproof vest until he was on stage.",Marvin Gaye | 1984 in California | 1984 in Los Angeles | 1984 in music | 1984 murders in the United States | 1984 controversies in the United States | April 1984 in the United States | Crimes in Los Angeles,"1983, 1984",Circumstances | Killing | Autopsy and funeral | Court case | Aftermath | Reactions | Memorials and tributes | References,"Location: Arlington Heights, Los Angeles, California, U.S. | Coordinates: 34°2′16″N 118°18′49″W﻿ / ﻿34.03778°N 118.31361°W﻿ / 34.03778; -118.31361 | Date: April 1, 1984; 41 years ago (1984-04-01) 12:38 pm (approx time) (Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8)) | Attack type: Murder by shooting | Weapon: .38 Special | Victim: Marvin Gaye (killed) | Perpetrator: Marvin Gay Sr.",2387,2025-06-22 19:37:20

He was the father of recording artists Marvin Gaye and Frankie Gaye and gained notoriety after shooting and killing his son Marvin on April 1, 1984, following an argument at their home. Gay was born the first of 13 children to George and Mamie Gay on October 1, 1914, on a farm along Catnip Hill Pike in Jessamine County, Kentucky and was raised in Lexington. He had a troubled childhood, where his physically abusive father would often beat his mother, him, and his five siblings. According to Gay's wife, Alberta, Gay's family life consisted of constant violence, involving domestic abuse and shootings. ""Gays against Gays"", she told author David Ritz. When Gay was still a child, he and his mother joined a Pentecostal church, the House of God. Gay moved to Washington, D.C., in his late teens to pursue a career as a minister of a House of God church there. While in Washington, Gay met his future wife, Alberta Cooper, whom he married on July 2, 1935. The couple bought a small house in southeastern Washington, D.C., at 1617 First Street SW, which was only a few blocks away from the Anacostia River. The street was nicknamed ""Simple City"" for its being ""half-city, half-country"". Alberta already had a son named Michael, but Gay sent Michael to live with his sister-in-law, Pearl. Two years after marrying, they had their first child, a daughter they named Jeanne. On April 2, 1939, their first son, Marvin Jr., was born. Son Frankie (born Frances) and daughter Zeola followed shortly afterwards.

Gaye's personal life, mainly documented in the biography, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, included his faith; child abuse by his father; personal relationships with his two wives, friends, and girlfriends; and bouts of depression and drug abuse. Gaye and his five siblings were brought up in a Black Hebrew Israelite sect known as the House of God by their father, Marvin Gay Sr., a minister in the sect. The House of God labels itself a ""Hebrew Pentecostal"" denomination, advocates strict conduct, and claims to adhere to both the Old and New Testaments. Gaye remembered the family having to observe an extended Sabbath starting from ""Friday night at sundown"" into Saturday—similar to Shabbat in mainstream Judaism. He later explained, ""We kept the Sabbath in the purest sense. Father anointed converts with olive oil and baptized them in the river. The Sabbath was his day, it was God's day, and it was also a day for singing. Every member was blessed with a good voice. The joy of music was the joy of God."" Gaye began singing solos during church services at the age of four. At times, Gaye's father would force his children to answer Biblical questions, disciplining them if they answered wrong. Gaye's relationship with his father was troubled from childhood. According to his sister, Jeanne, Gaye suffered at the hands of his father, who would strike him for any shortcoming, including putting his hairbrush in the wrong place or coming home from school a minute late. Gaye's sister recalled that Gaye would ""constantly provoke Father. He disappeared on Saturday mornings when it was time to go to church."" Jeanne Gaye explained that, between the ages of 7 and well into his teenage years, Gaye's home life ""consisted of a series of brutal whippings."" Gaye explained his father's abuse to author David Ritz years later: ""It wasn't simply that my father beat me, though that was bad enough. By the time I was twelve, there wasn't an inch on my body that hadn't been bruised and beaten by him."" He stated what made the beatings worse was his father prolonging the time before punishing Gaye, making him remove his clothes and having him hear his father's belt buckle long before he received the punishment. Gaye felt a part of his father was ""enjoying the whole thing"".

Thomas Askwith, the official tasked with designing the British 'detention and rehabilitation' programme during the summer and autumn of 1953, termed his system the Pipeline. The British did not initially conceive of rehabilitating Mau Mau suspects through brute force and other ill-treatment—Askwith's final plan, submitted to Baring in October 1953, was intended as ""a complete blueprint for winning the war against Mau Mau using socioeconomic and civic reform."" What developed, however, has been described as a British gulag. Two types of work camps were set up. The first type were based in Kikuyu districts with the stated purpose of achieving the Swynnerton Plan; the second were punitive camps, designed for the 30,000 Mau Mau suspects who were deemed unfit to return to the reserves. These forced-labour camps provided a much needed source of labour to continue the colony's infrastructure development. Colonial officers also saw the second sort of works camps as a way of ensuring that any confession was legitimate and as a final opportunity to extract intelligence. Probably the worst works camp to have been sent to was the one run out of Embakasi Prison, for Embakasi was responsible for the Embakasi Airport, the construction of which was demanded to be finished before the Emergency came to an end. The airport was a massive project with an unquenchable thirst for labour, and the time pressures ensured the detainees' forced labour was especially hard. The following list includes detention camps of various types, organized by district or province. The Museum of British Colonialism is also documenting the camps for exhibitions and awareness.",Mau Mau rebellion | British war crimes | Internment camps of the British Empire | Internment camps by war | Kenya history-related lists,"1953, 1960, 1952",Fort Hall District | Kirinyaga District | Meru District | Nyeri District | Kiambu District | Rift Valley Province | Coast Province | Southern Province,,1763,2025-06-22 19:41:07
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau_Maus,Mau Maus,Mau Mau uprising Kenya,"Mau Maus was the name of a 1950s street gang in New York City. The book and the adapted film The Cross and the Switchblade and biography Run Baby Run document the life of its most famous leader Nicky Cruz. Their name was derived from the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. Nicky Cruz wrote a book about his experiences called Run Baby Run. Israel Narvaez committed his life to God and wrote a book called Second Chance: The Israel Narvaez Story. David Wilkerson wrote a biography The Cross and the Switchblade and a film of the same name was released. The Mau Maus were a Brooklyn Puerto Rican gang operating from 1957 to around 1962. Some members of a street gang called the Apaches broke away and created the Mau Maus, according to Israel Narvaez, one of the gang's founders. The Apaches had succumbed to heroin while Narvaez and others were more interested in fighting and maintaining territory. They also asked permission from a rival gang called the Chaplains to start a Puerto Rican gang in the area. Eventually the gang was called Mau Mau Chaplains. Research published in 2018 established that the gang was formed in 1957 by Puerto Rican youths who lived in the Fort Greene Housing Project in Brooklyn, New York. The youths began by approaching the dominant local gang, the Chaplains, to discuss the idea of a new gang. They were supported by Earl Tooley, a leading Chaplain, and the new gang was initially called the Mau Mau Chaplains before becoming simply the Mau Maus. The first leaders were Juan Seda as president, Israel Narvaez as Vice-President and Carlos Reyes as Warlord. The name Mau Maus was chosen after the members watched the movie Something Of Value (released in May 1957 in the United States) about the Mau Mau uprising in East Africa. Around January 1958 a member of the rival Bishop gang and a candy store owner were stabbed to death by some of the Mau Mau gang, supposedly in retaliation for the Bishops' killing of Mannie Durango, a member of the Mau Maus. One of its best known members was Nicky Cruz, who was president, Vice President, and Warlord at different points during his tenure. Cruz said he stabbed 16 people while a member.",Former gangs in New York City | Hispanic-American gangs | Organizations based in New York City | Puerto Rican culture in New York City | Street gangs,"1958, 1957, 1962, 2018",History | See also | References | External links,"Founding location: New York City, New York, United States | Years active: 1950–1965 | Territory: United States, New York City Area | Ethnicity: Puerto Rican | Criminal activities: Drug trafficking, arms trafficking, assassination, bribery, kidnapping, extortion, money laundering, murder, racketeering. | Rivals: BishopsApachesother gangs",2155,2025-06-22 19:41:08
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Land_and_Freedom_Army,Kenya Land and Freedom Army,Mau Mau uprising Kenya,"The Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), also known as the Mau Mau, was a Kenyan insurgent group which fought against British colonial rule in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion from 1952 to 1960. Its membership consisted largely of the Kikuyu people. The KLFA was led by Dedan Kimathi for most of its existence. After four years, British forces managed to destroy the KFLA militarily, and Kimathi was captured and executed in 1957. Though the Mau Mau rebellion was ultimately suppressed, it played a major role in achieving Kenya's independence, which occurred in 1963. The KLFA's membership consisted largely of the Kikuyu people, many of whom had their lands confiscated by British colonial officials and given to white settlers during the early 20th century. The KFLA espoused African nationalist and anti-colonial ideologies, and was led by Dedan Kimathi for most of its existence. The KFLA began what is now called the Mau Mau uprising in 1952. After four years of counterinsurgency operations, British forces managed to largely neutralise the KFLA as a military threat, and Kimathi was captured and executed by the colonial authorities in 1957. The Mau Mau rebellion was fully defeated by 1960. During the rebellion, thousands of KFLA insurgents were killed by the British, including 1,090 people who were executed by the colonial authorities. Official numbers state that 11,000 insurgents were killed, though the Kenya Human Rights Commission has estimated that ""90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown, and 160,000 were detained in appalling conditions"". Oxford University professor David Anderson estimated that up to 25,000 people were killed during the conflict. The colonial administration also interned at least 80,000 Kenyans suspected of being affiliated with the KFLA in detention camps, with some estimates of the number of detainees being as high as 320,000 people. Torture was widespread against detainees, and in 1959 11 prisoners were killed by camp guards in the Hola massacre. The KFLA also committed numerous atrocities, including the Lari massacre, and murdered at least 1,819 Kenyan civilians.",1940s in Kenya | 1950s in Kenya | 1960s in Kenya | African and Black nationalist organizations in Africa | Guerrilla organizations | Rebel groups in Kenya | Mau Mau rebellion,"1963, 1959, 1960, 1957, 1952",History | Origins | Mau Mau uprising | Structure | Information systems | Aftermath and impact | References,"Leaders: Dedan Kimathi | Dates of operation: 1952–1960 | Newspaper: High Command [1] | Ideology: Anti-colonialismAnti-imperialismKenyan nationalismKikuyu interests | Size: 35,000+[2] | Opponents: United Kingdom

After college, Evers became active in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. Following the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers challenged the segregation of the state-supported public University of Mississippi. He applied to law school there, as the state had no public law school for African Americans. He also worked for voting rights, economic opportunity, access to public facilities, and other changes in the segregated society.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Evers,Charles Evers,Medgar Evers,"James Charles Evers (September 11, 1922 – July 22, 2020) was an American civil rights activist, businessman, radio personality, and politician. Evers was known for his role in the civil rights movement along with his younger brother Medgar Evers. After serving in World War II, Evers began his career as a disc jockey at WHOC in Philadelphia, Mississippi. In 1954, he was made the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) State Voter Registration chairman. After his brother's assassination in 1963, Evers took over his position as field director of the NAACP in Mississippi. In this role, he organized and led many demonstrations for the rights of African Americans. In 1969, Evers was named ""Man of the Year"" by the NAACP. On June 3, 1969, Evers was elected in Fayette, Mississippi, as the first African-American mayor of a biracial town in Mississippi since the Reconstruction era, following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which enforced constitutional rights for citizens. At the time of Evers's election as mayor, the town of Fayette had a population of 1,600 of which 75% was African-American and almost 25% white; the white officers on the Fayette city police ""resigned rather than work under a black administration,"" according to the Associated Press. Evers told reporters ""I guess we will just have to operate with an all-black police department for the present. But I am still looking for some whites to join us in helping Fayette grow."" Evers then outlawed the carrying of firearms within city limits. He ran for governor in 1971 and the United States Senate in 1978, both times as an independent candidate. In 1989, Evers was defeated for re-election after serving sixteen years as mayor. In his later life, he became a Republican, endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980, and more recently Donald Trump in 2016. This diversity in party affiliations throughout his life was reflected in his fostering of friendships with people from a variety of backgrounds, as well as his advising of politicians from across the political spectrum. After his political career ended, he returned to radio and hosted his own show, Let's Talk. In 2017, Evers was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame for his contributions to the music industry.",1922 births | 2020 deaths | Activists for African-American civil rights | African-American mayors in Mississippi | 20th-century mayors of places in Mississippi | African-American DJs | Alcorn State University alumni | United States Army personnel of World War II,"1922, 1965, 1963, 1978, 1954, 2020, 1971, 1989, 1969",Early life and education | Career | Business activities | Civil rights activism | Mayor of Fayette | 1971 gubernatorial campaign | Later political career | Books,Preceded by: Kennie Middleton | Succeeded by: Kennie Middleton,2284,2025-06-22 19:38:57

She also served as chairwoman of the NAACP, and has published several books on topics related to civil rights and her husband's legacy. On January 21, 2013, she delivered the invocation at the second inauguration of Barack Obama. Evers-Williams was born Myrlie Louise Beasley on March 17, 1933, in her maternal grandmother's home in Vicksburg, Mississippi. She was the daughter of James Van Dyke Beasley, a delivery man, and Mildred Washington Beasley, who was 16 years old. Myrlie's parents separated when she was just a year old; her mother left Vicksburg but decided that Myrlie was too young to travel with her. Since her maternal grandmother worked all day in service, with no time to raise a child, Myrlie was raised by her paternal grandmother, Annie McCain Beasley, and an aunt, Myrlie Beasley Polk. Both women were respected school teachers and they inspired her to follow in their footsteps. Myrlie attended the Magnolia school, took piano lessons, and performed songs, piano pieces or recited poetry at school, in church, and at local clubs. Myrlie graduated from Magnolia High School (Bowman High School) in 1950. During her years in high school, Myrlie was also a member of the Chansonettes, a girls’ vocal group from Mount Heroden Baptist Church in Vicksburg. In 1950, Myrlie enrolled at Alcorn A&M College, one of the few colleges in the state that accepted African-American students, as an education major intending to minor in music. Myrlie is also a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. On her first day of school Myrlie met and fell in love with Medgar Evers, a World War II veteran eight years her senior. The meeting changed her college plans, and the couple later married on Christmas Eve of 1951. They later moved to Mound Bayou, where they had their first child, Darrell Kenyatta, named for the imprisoned African leader, Jomo Kenyatta. In Mound Bayou, Myrlie worked as a secretary at the Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Domestic life was strained by her husband's formal application to law school as his parents were opposed, Myrlie was expecting her second child, the family was financially restricted and unprepared for the increasing public exposure on his stealthy voting rights activities in the Delta.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson,Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his music achievements broke racial barriers in America and made him a dominant figure across the world. Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music; popularizing street dance moves including the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time based on his acclaim and records. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his public debut in 1964 at age six, as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). After signing with Motown in 1968, the band achieved worldwide success with him as its lead singer. Jackson achieved solo stardom with the release of his fifth album Off the Wall (1979). He followed it up with Thriller (1982), the best-selling album of all time, which catapulted him to a rare level of fame, whilst aiding in the popularization of MTV and revolutionizing the music video medium with the videos for its title track along with ""Beat It"" and ""Billie Jean"". Jackson furthered his position as a global superstar with Bad (1987), the world's best-selling album of both 1987 and 1988, as well as the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Bad"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Man in the Mirror"", and ""Dirty Diana"". Dangerous (1991) marked a new era for Jackson, lauded as his most artistic and socially conscious album. HIStory (1995) produced ""You Are Not Alone"", the first song to debut at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. His final album, Invincible, was released in 2001. From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. He was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend in 1993. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and all other charges. While preparing for This Is It (a series of comeback concerts), Jackson died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter.

His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said that he found Jackson in his bedroom at his North Carolwood Drive home in the Holmby Hills area of the city not breathing and with a weak pulse; he administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to no avail, and security called 9-1-1 at 12:21 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (UTC–7). Paramedics treated Jackson at the scene, but he was pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Westwood at 2:26 p.m. On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner concluded that Jackson's death was a homicide. Jackson had been administered propofol and anti-anxiety benzodiazepines lorazepam and midazolam by his doctor. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011, and was released in 2013 after serving two years of his four-year prison sentence with time off for good behavior. At the time of his death, Jackson had been preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, due to begin in July 2009 in London, United Kingdom. Following his death there were unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service, held at the Staples Center (later renamed to Crypto.com Arena) in Los Angeles, had an estimated 2.5 billion viewers. In 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a US$250 million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017 and to release seven posthumous albums of unreleased material over the following decade, but only two were ever released. At the time of his death, Jackson was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, due to begin in July 2009 at the O2 Arena in London. On June 24 Jackson arrived for rehearsal at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, at around 6:30 p.m. According to the magician Ed Alonzo, Jackson jokingly complained of laryngitis and did not rehearse until 9 p.m. ""He looked great and had great energy,"" Alonzo said.

She is the second child and only daughter of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe. In 2020, Jackson signed a deal with Republic Records. Her debut album, Wilted, was released the same year. Jackson was born on April 3, 1998, at Spaulding Pain Medical Clinic in Beverly Hills, California, and was named after the French capital city in which she was conceived. Her name also comes from a promise that her father, aunt La Toya, and Kathy Hilton made when they were younger that if they were to have a daughter, they would name her Paris. She is the middle child and only daughter of singer Michael Jackson and younger child of Debbie Rowe. Rowe is Jewish, which by extension makes Paris Jewish by birth, according to Judaism. She has one older brother named Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (""Prince"") and one younger half-brother named Prince Michael Jackson II (""Bigi"", formerly known as ""Blanket""). Paris was raised solely by her father, who received full custody rights following his and Rowe's divorce in 2000; Rowe had stated it was her intention and agreed upon with Michael that he would raise and have custody of the children. Reports alleged that the relationship was an ""economic"" transaction for Rowe, as Jackson wanted a baby. She grew up at Neverland Ranch with her siblings. Her father made Elizabeth Taylor and Macaulay Culkin the godparents of her and her brother Prince. During her childhood, she and her siblings often wore masks during public outings with their father to hide their faces from the public and press. When Jackson's father unexpectedly died on June 25, 2009, she and her siblings were taken into the care of their grandmother and their cousin Tito Joe Jackson (""TJ""). On July 7, 2009, during the televised memorial for Michael, then 11-year-old Jackson concluded the service saying ""I just wanted to say, ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine."" Consoled by her aunts, uncles and grandmother she continued ""And I just wanted to say I love him so much,"" before she burst into tears and threw herself into aunt Janet Jackson's arms. In 2010, Jackson and her brothers gave an interview for Oprah Winfrey alongside their grandmother Katherine and their cousins about life after her father's death. She and her brother Prince also accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 Grammy Awards on their father's behalf.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Michael_Jackson,Trial of Michael Jackson,Michael Jackson,"People v. Jackson (full title: 1133603: The People of the State of California v. Michael Joe Jackson) was a 2005 criminal trial held in Santa Barbara County Superior Court in Santa Maria, California. The American pop singer Michael Jackson was charged with molesting Gavin Arvizo, who was 13 years old at the time of the alleged abuse, at his Neverland Ranch estate in Los Olivos, California. Jackson was first accused of child sexual abuse in 1993; he denied the allegations and settled in a civil lawsuit. In 2003, the documentary Living with Michael Jackson showed Jackson holding hands with Arvizo and defending his practice of giving his bed to children, triggering an investigation. Jackson was indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor to molest him, one count of attempted child molestation, one count of conspiring to hold the Arvizo family captive, and conspiring to commit extortion and child abduction. The trial spanned approximately four months, beginning with jury selection that began on January 31, 2005. Gavin and his brother testified that Jackson had given them alcohol, showed them pornography, masturbated before them, and made sexual advances. The defense characterized the witnesses for the prosecution as disgruntled ex-employees or individuals seeking to exploit Jackson for money. Witnesses for the defense included testimony from celebrities including the former child actor Macaulay Culkin and the comedian Chris Tucker. Coverage of the trial was described as a media circus, and many media outlets were quick to portray Jackson as guilty. Jackson was acquitted on all counts on June 13, 2005. He never returned to Neverland Ranch, and spent the first several months after the trial living abroad in Bahrain and Ireland. In 2013, four years after Jackson's death, one of the defense witnesses, Wade Robson, changed his position and filed a lawsuit, saying he had been abused by Jackson.","2005 in California | 2005 in United States case law | June 2005 in the United States | 2000s trials | 21st-century American trials | Criminal trials that ended in acquittal | Michael Jackson | Santa Maria, California","2005, 1993, 2013, 2003",Timeline in the allegations between the Arvizo family and Michael Jackson | Background | Investigation and arrest | Trial | Witnesses for the prosecution | Witnesses for the defense | 1994 settlement | Verdict,"Court: Santa Barbara County Superior Court | Full case name: The People of the State of California v.

From the mid-1980s, Jackson's appearance began to change dramatically. The changes to his face triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery, and his skin tone became much lighter. Jackson was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition, he used fair-colored makeup and skin-lightening prescription creams to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin. The lighter skin resulted in criticism that he was trying to appear white. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father Joe Jackson. In 2003, Joe admitted to whipping them as children, but he emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health problems later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder. At some point during the 1990s, it appeared that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. Jackson gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993. While preparing for a series of comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.",Burn survivors | Drug-related deaths in California | Health by individual | Michael Jackson | African-American health | Public image by individuals,"1993, 2003, 2009",Skin color | Cosmetic procedures | Nose surgeries | Facial structure | Physical health | Burns and scalp surgery | Dehydration | Orthopedic problems,,1983,2025-06-22 19:37:06
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage,Middle Passage,Middle Passage slavery,"The Middle Passage was the stage of the Atlantic slave trade in which millions of Africans sold for enslavement were forcibly transported to the Americas as part of the triangular slave trade. Ships departed Europe for African markets with manufactured goods (first side of the triangle), which were then traded for captive Africans. Slave ships transported the African captives across the Atlantic (second side of the triangle). The proceeds from selling these enslaved people were then used to buy products such as furs and hides, tobacco, sugar, rum, and raw materials, which would be transported back to Europe (third side of the triangle, completing it). The First Passage was the forced march of Africans from their inland homes, where they had been captured for enslavement by rulers of other African states or members of their own ethnic group, to African ports. Here they were imprisoned until they were sold and loaded onto a ship. The Final Passage was the journey from the port of disembarkation in the Americas to the plantation or other destination for enslavement into forced labor. The Middle Passage across the Atlantic joined these two. Voyages on the Middle Passage were large financial undertakings, generally organized by companies or groups of investors rather than individuals. The first European slave ship transported African captives from São Tomé to New Spain in 1525. Portuguese and Dutch traders dominated the trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, though by the 18th they were supplanted by the British and French. Other European nations involved were Spain, Denmark–Norway, Sweden, Poland–Lithuania, Prussia, and various Italian city-states as well as traders from the United States. The enslaved Africans came mostly from the regions of Senegambia, Upper Guinea, Windward Coast, Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, Bight of Biafra, and Angola. With the growing abolitionist movement in Europe and the Americas, the transatlantic slave trade gradually declined until being fully abolished in the second-half of the 19th century. According to modern research, roughly 15 million enslaved Africans were transported through the Middle Passage to the Americas. They were transported in wretched conditions, men and women separated, across the Atlantic. Mortality was high; those with strong bodies survived. Young women and girls were raped by the crew. An estimated 19% of them died during voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself during the process of cap",Atlantic slave trade | History of the Atlantic Ocean | Pre-emancipation African-American history,"1900, 1500, 1525",Journey | Sailing technologies | Treatment of enslaved people and resistance | Sailors and crew | See also | References | Further reading | External links,,3305,2025-06-22 19:40:48
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_medieval_Europe,Slavery in medieval Europe,Middle Passage slavery,"Slavery in medieval Europe was widespread. Europe and North Africa were part of an interconnected trade network across the Mediterranean Sea, and this included slave trading. During the medieval period, wartime captives were commonly forced into slavery. As European kingdoms transitioned to feudal societies, a different legal category of unfree persons – serfdom – began to replace slavery as the main economic and agricultural engine. Throughout medieval Europe, the perspectives and societal roles of enslaved peoples differed greatly, from some being restricted to agricultural labor to others being positioned as trusted political advisors. Slavery in the Early Middle Ages (500–1000) was initially a continuation of earlier Roman practices from late antiquity, and was continued by an influx of captives in the wake of the social chaos caused by the barbarian invasions of the Western Roman Empire. With the continuation of Roman legal practices of slavery, new laws and practices concerning slavery spread throughout Europe. For example, the Welsh laws of Hywel the Good included provisions dealing with slaves.(p 44) In the Germanic realms, laws instituted the enslavement of criminals, such as the Visigothic Code's prescribing enslavement for criminals who could not pay financial penalties for their crimes and as an actual punishment for various other crimes. Such criminals would become slaves to their victims, often with their property. As these peoples Christianized, the church worked more actively to reduce the practice of holding coreligionists in bondage. St. Patrick, who himself was captured and enslaved at one time, protested an attack that enslaved newly baptized Christians in his letter to the soldiers of Coroticus.(p 43) The restoration of order and the growing power of the church slowly transmuted the late Roman slave system of Diocletian into serfdom.[citation needed] Another major factor was the rise of Bathilde (626–680), queen of the Franks, who had been enslaved before marrying Clovis II. When she became regent, her government outlawed slave-trading of Christians throughout the Merovingian empire. About ten percent of England's population entered in the Domesday Book (1086) were slaves, despite chattel slavery of English Christians being nominally discontinued after the 1066 conquest. It is difficult to be certain about slave numbers, however, since the old Roman word for slave (servus) continued to be applied to unfree people whose status later was",Slavery in Europe | History of slavery | Medieval society | Slavery in the Middle Ages,"1066, 1000, 1086",Early Middle Ages | Slave trade | Italian merchants | Iberia | Vikings | Mongols | England and Ireland | Christians holding Muslim slaves,,2528,2025-06-22 19:40:49
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasoning_(slavery),Seasoning (slavery),Middle Passage slavery,"Seasoning, or the Seasoning, was the period of adjustment that slave traders and slaveholders subjected African slaves to following their arrival in the Americas. While modern scholarship has occasionally applied this term to the brief period of acclimatization undergone by European immigrants to the Americas, it most frequently and formally referred to the process undergone by enslaved people. Slave traders used the term ""seasoning"" to refer to the process of adjusting the enslaved Africans to the new climate, diet, geography, and ecology of the Americas. The term applied to both the physical acclimatization of the enslaved person to the environment, as well as that person's adjustment to a new social environment, labor regimen, and language. Slave traders and owners believed that if slaves survived this critical period of environmental seasoning, they were less likely to die and the psychological element would make them more easily controlled. This process took place immediately after the arrival of enslaved people during which their mortality rates were particularly high. These ""new"" or ""saltwater"" slaves were described as ""outlandish"" on arrival. Those who survived this process became ""seasoned"", and typically commanded a higher price in the market. For example, in eighteenth century Brazil, the price differential between ""new"" and ""seasoned"" slaves was about fifteen percent.[clarification needed][failed verification] Atlantic Creoles made up the first generations of enslaved people. Atlantic creoles were often mixed-race, integrated into and familiar with European society and gained freedom at higher rates prior to the eighteenth century. The first half of the 18th century saw a shift in Atlantic slavery. While tobacco, sugar, and rice took root in the Caribbean and North American colonies, the enslaved population of the New World shifted from a ""society with slaves"" to a ""slave society"" with the predominance of ""saltwater slavery"" -- enslavement through the Atlantic slave trade. With the expansion of the slave trade in the mid-eighteenth century, the nature of slavery changed. Operating on a larger scale, slave traders transported enslaved Africans to various European colonies throughout the Americas (both before and after the decolonization of the Americas), systematizing both the voyage and the process of seasoning, though it varied locationally and temporally. While slave traders and owners practiced seasoning in both North and South America, it w",European colonization of the Americas | Slavery in the Caribbean | Early modern society | Physiology | Tropical diseases | Mind control | Slavery in North America | Slavery in South America,1803,Regional variance | Diet | Disease | Labor and violence | Resistance | See also | References | Bibliography,,3959,2025-06-22 19:40:50
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_slavery_in_the_United_States,End of slavery in the United States,Middle Passage slavery,"From the late 18th century to the 1860s, various states of the United States allowed the enslavement of human beings, most of whom had been transported from Africa during the Atlantic slave trade or were their descendants. The institution of chattel slavery was established in North America in the 16th century under Spanish colonization, British colonization, French colonization, and Dutch colonization. After the United States was founded in 1776, the country split into slave states (states permitting slavery) and free states (states prohibiting slavery). Slavery became concentrated in the Southern United States. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves banned the Atlantic slave trade starting in 1808, but not the domestic slave trade or slavery itself. Slavery was finally ended throughout the entire country after the American Civil War (1861–1865), in which the U.S. government defeated a confederation of rebelling slave states that attempted to secede from the U.S. During the war, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which ordered the liberation of all slaves in rebelling states. In December 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, abolishing chattel slavery nationwide. The major institution of slavery existed in some parts of the United States for 76 years; from March 4, 1789, when the United States federal government began to function as a country with its first Congress; until abolished on December 18, 1865. Native American slave ownership also persisted until 1866, when the federal government negotiated new treaties with the ""Five Civilized Tribes"" in which they agreed to end slavery. Some argue slavery continues to exist in other forms by the clauses of the 13th amendment.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis,Miles Davis,Miles Davis jazz,"Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a roughly five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz. Born into an upper-middle-class family in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis started on the trumpet in his early teens. He left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, while addicted to heroin, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music under Prestige Records. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records, and recorded the album 'Round About Midnight in 1955. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music–influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S. Davis made several lineup changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another commercial success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P. (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing lineup of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, bassist Michael Henderson and guitarist John McLaughlin.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis_discography,Miles Davis discography,Miles Davis jazz,"Miles Davis was an American trumpeter, bandleader and musical composer. His discography consists of at least 60 studio albums and 39 live albums, as well as 46 compilation albums, 27 box sets, 4 soundtrack albums, 57 singles and 3 remix albums. Davis' initial appearances on record were mainly as a member of bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker's quintet from 1944 through 1947 and released on the Savoy label. Davis made his debut as a leader in the 1946 sessions featuring Parker, pianist John Lewis, bassist Nelson Boyd and drummer Max Roach. Prestige Records released Davis' debut album, The New Sounds, in 1951. He recorded many studio albums under the Prestige label from 1951 through 1956, as well as Blue Moods, issued by Debut Records in 1955, and three sessions for Blue Note Records. The earliest Davis music released was recorded from April 4, 1945 through August 14, 1947, and reissued in CD format by Savoy Records under the title First Miles. From 1949 through 1950, Davis recorded twelve tunes with a nonet consisting of other noted jazz musicians including arranger Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, Lee Konitz, John Lewis, Max Roach and Kenny Clarke. The arrangements for that group were scored for instruments rarely used in jazz such as French horn and tuba. These recordings, which were labeled cool jazz and eventually appeared on the album Birth of the Cool in 1957 by Capitol Records, marked an important influence on the future of jazz. He later signed to Columbia and released 'Round About Midnight on March 18, 1957. His acclaimed 1959 album Kind of Blue is generally stated to be the best-selling jazz album of all time, although the data are not conclusive. The follow-up album in 1960, Sketches of Spain, went gold. He formed his Second Great Quintet in 1964. With the release of Miles in the Sky, Davis permanently abandoned hard bop, instead adopting jazz fusion and avant-garde jazz. In this era he released the studio album Bitches Brew, which was certified platinum, culminating in the long electric jams from the mid-1970s released as Pangaea, Agharta, and Dark Magus. After a six-year retirement, Davis released albums under the Columbia and Warner Bros. labels during the period between 1981 and 1991. These recordings combined jazz with popular music genres as he turned more toward the mainstream. He finished his music career with Doo-Bop, in which he experimentally combined jazz with hip-hop, his discography ultimately being extensively sampled in hip-hop, such as w",Jazz discographies | Miles Davis | Discographies of American artists,"1956, 1951, 1945, 1944, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1955","Studio albums | Prestige/Blue Note/Debut, 1951–1961 | Columbia, 1955–1976 | Columbia/Warner Bros., 1981–1991 | Live albums | Compilations and remixes | Soundtracks | Box sets",Studio albums: 60 | Soundtrack albums: 4 | Live albums: 39 | Compilation albums: 46 | Singles: 57 | Video albums: 27,2544,2025-06-22 19:37:40
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis_Quintet,Miles Davis Quintet,Miles Davis jazz,"The Miles Davis Quintet was an American jazz band from 1955 to early 1969 led by Miles Davis. The quintet underwent frequent personnel changes toward its metamorphosis into a different ensemble in 1969. Most references pertain to two distinct and relatively stable bands: the First Great Quintet from 1955 to 1958, and the Second Great Quintet from late 1964 to early 1969, Davis being the only constant throughout. In the summer of 1955, after Davis performed at the Newport Jazz Festival, he was approached by Columbia Records executive George Avakian, who offered him a contract if he could form a regular band. Davis assembled his first regular quintet to meet a commitment at the Café Bohemia in July with Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. By the autumn, Rollins had left to deal with his heroin addiction, and later in the year joined the hard bop quintet led by Clifford Brown and Max Roach. At the recommendation of drummer Jones, Davis replaced Rollins with John Coltrane, beginning a partnership that would last five years and finalizing the Quintet's first line-up. Expanded to a sextet with the addition of Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone in 1958, the First Great Quintet was one of the definitive hard bop groups along with the Brown-Roach Quintet and the Jazz Messengers, recording the Columbia albums 'Round About Midnight, Milestones, and the marathon sessions for Prestige Records resulting in four albums collected on The Legendary Prestige Quintet Sessions. In mid-1958, Bill Evans replaced Garland on piano and Jimmy Cobb replaced Jones on drums, but Evans only remained for about six months, in turn replaced by Wynton Kelly as 1958 turned into 1959. This group backing Davis, Coltrane, and Adderley, with Evans returning for the recording sessions, recorded Kind of Blue, considered ""one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz"". Adderley left the band in September 1959 to pursue his own career, returning the line-up to a quintet. Coltrane departed in the spring of 1960, and after interim replacements Jimmy Heath and Sonny Stitt, Davis plus Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb continued through 1961 and 1962 with Hank Mobley on tenor sax.",Cool jazz ensembles | Bebop ensembles | Miles Davis | John Coltrane | Jazz ensembles from New York City | Hard bop ensembles | Musical groups established in 1955 | 1955 establishments in New York City,"1964, 1958, 1955, 1969",First Great Quintet/Sextet (1955–58) | Second Great Quintet (1964–68) | Lost Quintet (1968–1970) | Personnel | First Great Quintet (1955–58) | Second Great Quintet (1964–68) | Lost Quintet (1968–1970) | Notes,,2259,2025-06-22 19:37:41
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestones_(Miles_Davis_album),Milestones (Miles Davis album),Miles Davis jazz,"Milestones is a studio album by Miles Davis. It was recorded with his ""first great quintet"" (augmented to a sextet with the addition of alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley) and released in September 1958 by Columbia Records. Tenor saxophonist John Coltrane's return to Davis' group in 1958 coincided with the ""modal phase"" albums: Milestones and Kind of Blue (1959) are both considered essential examples of 1950s modern jazz. Davis at this point was experimenting with modes – scale patterns other than major and minor. Davis plays both trumpet and piano on ""Sid's Ahead"", a blues which is reminiscent of ""Walkin'"" that Davis had recorded under the title ""Weirdo"" for Blue Note in 1954. He plays trumpet in the ensemble passages and solos on trumpet but moves to the piano to accompany the saxophonists and Paul Chambers's bass solo in the absence of pianist Red Garland. ""Billy Boy"" is a solo feature for Garland and the rhythm section. In a five-star review, AllMusic's Thom Jurek called Milestones a classic album with blues material in both bebop and post-bop veins, as well as the ""memorable"" title track, which introduced modalism in jazz and defined Davis' subsequent music in the years to follow. Andy Hermann of PopMatters felt that the album offers more aggressive swinging than Kind of Blue and showcases the first session between saxophonists Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, whose different styles ""feed off each other and push each musician to greater heights."" Jim Santella of All About Jazz said that the quality of the personnel Davis enlisted was ""the very best"", even though the sextet was short-lived, and that Milestones is ""a seminal album that helped shape jazz history.""",1958 albums | Albums produced by George Avakian | Albums recorded at CBS 30th Street Studio | Columbia Records albums | Miles Davis albums,"1959, 1958, 1954",Composition | Critical reception | Stereo remix and remaster | Track listing | Personnel | References | External links,"Released: September 2, 1958 (1958-09-02)[1][2] | Recorded: February 4 and March 4, 1958 | Studio: Columbia 30th Street (New York City) | Genre: Jazz, modal jazz, bebop | Length: 47:36",1697,2025-06-22 19:37:42
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Smiles,Miles Smiles,Miles Davis jazz,"Miles Smiles is an album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released on February 16, 1967 by Columbia Records. It was recorded by Davis and his second quintet at Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City on October 24 and October 25, 1966. It is the second of six albums recorded by Davis' second great quintet, which featured tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams. Miles Smiles showcases Davis' deeper exploration of modal performance with looser forms, tempos, and meters. Although the album did not follow the conventions of bop, neither did it follow the formlessness of free jazz. According to musicologist Jeremy Yudkin, Miles Smiles falls under the post-bop subgenre, which he defines as ""an approach that is abstract and intense in the extreme, with space created for rhythmic and coloristic independence of the drummer—an approach that incorporated modal and chordal harmonies, flexible form, structured choruses, melodic variation, and free improvisation."" Music theorist Keith Waters writes that the album ""accentuated the quintet's connections to both the hard bop tradition and the avant-garde."" On three tracks from this album—""Orbits"", ""Dolores"", and ""Ginger Bread Boy""—pianist Herbie Hancock takes the unusual liberty of dispensing with left-hand chords and playing only right-hand lines. ""Freedom Jazz Dance"" has more conventional accompaniment from the piano, although the quintet altered Eddie Harris' composition by inserting additional bars between the melodic phrases of the piece, as well as performing the piece at a slightly faster tempo. Wayne Shorter's composition ""Footprints"" was first recorded for his album Adam's Apple, but on Miles Smiles, the correlation between African-based 128 (or 68), and 44 is playfully explored. Drummer Tony Williams freely moves from swing, to the three-over-two cross rhythm—and to its 44 correlative. The rhythmic approach of Williams, and bassist Ron Carter, strongly suggests compound quadruple meter (128), rather than triple meter (34), because the ground of four main beats is maintained throughout the piece. The bass switches to 44 at 2:20. Carter’s 44 figure is known as tresillo in Afro-Cuban music and is the duple-pulse correlative of the 128 figure. This may have been the first overt expression of systemic, African-based cross-rhythm used by a straight ahead jazz group. During Davis’ first trumpet solo, Williams shifts to a 44 jazz ride pattern while",1967 albums | Miles Davis albums | Columbia Records albums | Albums produced by Teo Macero | Albums recorded at CBS 30th Street Studio | 1960s instrumental albums,"1967, 1966","Music | ""Footprints"" | The Davis ""book"" | Reception and legacy | Track listing | Personnel | Musicians | Production","Released: February 16, 1967[1] | Recorded: October 24–25, 1966 (1966-10-24 – 1966-10-25) | Studio: Columbia 30th Street Studio, New York City | Genre: Post-bop[2]

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Négritude,Négritude,Negritude movement,"Négritude (from French ""nègre"" and ""-itude"" to denote a condition that can be translated as ""Blackness"") is a framework of critique and literary theory, mainly developed by francophone intellectuals, writers, and politicians in the African diaspora during the 1930s, aimed at raising and cultivating ""black consciousness"" across Africa and its diaspora. Négritude gathers writers such as sisters Paulette and Jeanne Nardal (known for having laid the theoretical basis of the movement), Martinican poet Aimé Césaire, Abdoulaye Sadji, Léopold Sédar Senghor (the first President of Senegal), and Léon Damas of French Guiana. Négritude intellectuals disavowed colonialism, racism and Eurocentrism. They promoted African culture within a framework of persistent Franco-African ties. The intellectuals employed Marxist political philosophy, in the black radical tradition. The writers drew heavily on a surrealist literary style, and some say they were also influenced somewhat by the Surrealist stylistics, and in their work often explored the experience of diasporic being, asserting one's self and identity, and ideas of home, home-going and belonging. Négritude inspired the birth of many movements across the Afro-Diasporic world, including Afro-Surrealism, Créolité in the Caribbean, and black is beautiful in the United States. Frantz Fanon often made reference to Négritude in his writing. Négritude is a constructed noun from the 1930s based upon the French word nègre, which, like its English counterpart, was derogatory and had a different meaning from ""black man"". The movement's use of the word Négritude was a way of re-imagining the word as an emic form of empowerment. The term was first used in its present sense by Aimé Césaire, in the third issue (May–June 1935) of L'Étudiant noir, a magazine that he had started in Paris with fellow students Léopold Senghor and Léon Damas, as well as Gilbert Gratiant [fr], Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, and Paulette Nardal. The word appears in Césaire's first published work, ""Conscience Raciale et Révolution Sociale"", with the heading ""Les Idées"" and the rubric ""Négreries"", which is notable for its disavowal of assimilation as a valid strategy for resistance and for its use of the word nègre as a positive term. The problem with assimilation was that one assimilated into a culture that considered African culture to be barbaric and unworthy of being seen as ""civilized"". The assimilation into this culture would have bee",1930s in Africa | African and Black nationalism | Africana philosophy | Black (human racial classification) | French Caribbean | French West Africa | Latin American literature | Literary movements,"1885, 1935",Etymology | Influences | Development during the 20th century | Reception | Other uses | See also | Notes | References,,3990,2025-06-22 19:40:15
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth,The Wretched of the Earth,Negritude movement,"The Wretched of the Earth (French: Les Damnés de la Terre) is a 1961 book by the philosopher Frantz Fanon, in which the author provides a psychoanalysis of the dehumanizing effects of colonization upon the individual and the nation, and discusses the broader social, cultural, and political implications of establishing a social movement for the decolonisation of a person and of a people. The French-language title derives from the opening lyrics of ""The Internationale"", which is reflected in the English title as well. Through critiques of nationalism and of imperialism, Fanon presents a discussion of personal and societal mental health, a discussion of how the use of language (vocabulary) is applied to the establishment of imperialist identities, such as coloniser and colonised, to teach and psychologically mould the native and the colonist into their respective roles as slave and master, and a discussion of the role of the intellectual in a revolution. Fanon proposes that revolutionaries should seek the help of the lumpenproletariat to provide the force required to effect the expulsion of the colonists. In traditional Marxist theory, the lumpenproletariats are the lowest, most degraded stratum of the proletariat—especially criminals, vagrants and the unemployed—people who lack the class consciousness to participate in the socialist revolution. Fanon applies the term lumpenproletariat to the colonial subjects who are not involved in industrial production, especially the peasantry, because, unlike the urban proletariat (the working class), the lumpenproletariat has sufficient intellectual independence from the dominant ideology of the colonial ruling class, ready to grasp that they can revolt against the colonial status quo and so decolonize their nation. One of the essays included in The Wretched of the Earth is ""On National Culture"", in which Fanon highlights the necessity for each generation to discover its mission and fight for it. The first section is entitled ""On Violence"". It is a detailed explanation of violence in relation to both the colonial world and the process of decolonization. Fanon begins with the premise that decolonization is, by definition, a violent process without exception. The object of that process is the eventual replacement of one group of humans with another, and that process is only complete when the transition is total. This conception of decolonization is based on Fanon's construction of the colonial world.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Consciousness_Movement,Black Consciousness Movement,Negritude movement,"The Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was a grassroots anti-apartheid activist movement that emerged in South Africa in the mid-1960s out of the political vacuum created by the jailing and banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress leadership after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness. [Black Consciousness'] origins were deeply rooted in Christianity. In 1966, the Anglican Church under the incumbent, Archbishop Robert Selby Taylor, convened a meeting which later on led to the foundation of the University Christian Movement (UCM). This was to become the vehicle for Black Consciousness. The BCM attacked what they saw as traditional white values, especially the ""condescending"" values of white liberals. They refused to engage white liberal opinion on the pros and cons of black consciousness, and emphasised the rejection of white monopoly on truth as a central tenet of their movement While this philosophy at first generated disagreement amongst black anti-apartheid activists within South Africa, it was soon adopted by most as a positive development. As a result, there emerged a greater cohesiveness and solidarity amongst black groups in general, which in turn brought black consciousness to the forefront of the anti-apartheid struggle within South Africa. The BCM's policy of perpetually challenging the dialectic of apartheid South Africa as a means of transforming Black thought into rejecting prevailing opinion or mythology to attain a larger comprehension brought it into direct conflict with the full force of the security apparatus of the apartheid regime. ""Black man, you are on your own"" became the rallying cry as mushrooming activity committees implemented what was to become a relentless campaign of challenge to what was then referred to by the BCM as ""the system"". It eventually sparked a confrontation on 16 June 1976 in the Soweto uprising, when Black children marched to protest both linguistic imperialism and coercive Afrikaans medium education in the townships. In response, 176 of the child protesters were fatally shot by South African security forces and both outrage and unrest spread like wildfire throughout the country.",Black Consciousness Movement | African and Black nationalism | Social movements in South Africa | Defunct political magazines,"1966, 1976, 1960",History | Early years: 1960–76 | Post-Soweto uprising: 1976–present | Controversies and criticism | Funding | Literature | Black Review | Black Viewpoint,,2250,2025-06-22 19:40:17
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitivism,Primitivism,Negritude movement,"In the arts of the Western world, Primitivism is a mode of aesthetic idealization that means to recreate the experience of the primitive time, place, and person, either by emulation or by re-creation. In Western philosophy, Primitivism proposes that the people of a primitive society possess a morality and an ethics that are superior to the urban value system of civilized people. In European art, the aesthetics of primitivism included techniques, motifs, and styles copied from the arts of Asian, African, and Australasian peoples perceived as primitive in relation to the urban civilization of Western Europe. In that light, the painter Paul Gauguin's inclusion of Tahitian imagery to his oil paintings was a characteristic borrowing of technique, motif, and style that was important for the development of Modern art (1860s–1970s) in the late 19th century. As a genre of Western art, Primitivism reproduced and perpetuated racist stereotypes, such as the ""noble savage"", with which colonialists justified white colonial rule over the non-white other in Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Moreover, the term primitivism also identifies the techniques, motifs, and styles of painting that predominated representational painting before the emergence of the Avant-garde; and also identifies the styles of naïve art and of folk art produced by amateur artists, such as Henri Rousseau, who painted for personal pleasure. Primitivism is a utopian style of art that means to represent the physical world of Nature and humanity's original state of nature with two styles: (i) chronological primitivism and (ii) cultural primitivism. In Europe, chronological primitivism proposes the moral superiority of a primitive way of life represented by the myth of a golden age of pre-societal harmony with Nature, as depicted in the Pastoral genres of European representational art and poetry. Notable examples of European cultural primitivism are the music of Igor Stravinsky, the Tahitian paintings of Paul Gauguin, and the African period artworks of Pablo Picasso. Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring (1913) is primitivist program music about the subject of Paganism, specifically the rite of human sacrifice in pre-christian Russia. Foregoing the aesthetic and technical restraints of Western musical composition, in The Rite of Spring the composer employs harsh consonance and dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms as a mode of Dionysian spontaneity in musical modernism.

He was ""one of the founders of the Négritude movement in Francophone literature"" and coined the word négritude in French. He founded the Parti progressiste martiniquais in 1958, and served in the French National Assembly from 1945 to 1993 and as President of the Regional Council of Martinique from 1983 to 1988. He was also the Mayor of Fort-de-France for 56 years, from 1945–2001. His works include the book-length poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (1939), Une Tempête, a response to William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, and Discours sur le colonialisme (Discourse on Colonialism), an essay describing the strife between the colonizers and the colonized. Césaire's works have been translated into many languages. Aimé Césaire was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, French Caribbean, in 1913. His father was a tax inspector, and his mother was a dressmaker. 'Although in his Cahier he evoked his childhood as poverty-stricken and squalid, his family was part of the island's small, black middle class.' His family moved to the capital of Martinique, Fort-de-France, in order for Césaire to attend the only secondary school on the island, Lycée Victor Schœlcher. He believed that he was of Igbo descent, and thought of his first name Aimé as a retention of an Igbo name; though the name is of French origin, ultimately from the Old French word amée, meaning beloved, its pronunciation is similar to the Igbo eme, which forms the basis for many Igbo given names. Césaire traveled to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le-Grand on an educational scholarship. In Paris, he passed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 and created the literary review L'Étudiant noir (The Black Student) with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Léon Damas.[a] Manifestos by these three students in its third number (May–June 1935) initiated the Négritude movement later substantial in both pan-Africanist theory and the actual decolonization of the French Empire in Africa. In 1934 Césaire was invited to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by his friend Petar Guberina where in Šibenik he started writing his poem Notebook of a Return to the Native Land, which was one of the first expressions of the concept of Négritude. Upon returning home to Martinique in 1936, Césaire began work on his long poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (Notebook of a Ret",Aimé Césaire | 1913 births | 2008 deaths | 20th-century French dramatists and playwrights | 20th-century French essayists | 20th-century French poets | 20th-century male writers | Black French politicians,"2008, 1958, 1983, 1993, 1945, 1988, 2001, 1939, 1913","Student, educator and poet | World War II | Political career | Later life | Legacy | Works | Discourse on Colonialism | Bibliography","Born: Aimé Fernand David Césaire(1913-06-26)26 June 1913Basse-Pointe, Martinique, France | Died: 17 April 2008(2008-04-17) (aged 94)Fort-de-France, Martinique, France | Education: École Normale Supérieure[1] | Occupation(s): Poet, author and politician | Known for: Négritude movement | Notable work: Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (1939)",3044,2025-06-22 19:40:19

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 that led a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state. Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president.

The country has 527 languages, seven of which are extinct. Nigeria also has over 1,150 dialects and ethnic groups. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausas that are predominantly in the north, the Yorubas who predominate in the southwest, and the Igbos in the southeast. There are many other ethnic groups with sizeable populations across the different parts of the country. The Kanuri people are located in the northeast part of Nigeria, the Tiv people are in the north central, and the Efik-Ibibio are in the south South. The Bini people are most frequent in the region between Yorubaland and Igboland. Nigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally nomadic Fulani can be found all over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are almost entirely Muslim, while the Igbo are almost completely Christian and so are the Bini and the Ibibio. The Yoruba make up about 21% of the country's population (estimated to be over 225 million) and are predominantly Christians and Muslims on equal footing, with a notable presence of traditionalists. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all of Nigeria's ethnic groups however, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian or Muslim beliefs, a practice known as syncretism.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nigeria,History of Nigeria,Nigeria history culture,"The history of Nigeria can be traced to the earliest inhabitants whose date remains at least 13,000 BC through the early civilizations such as the Nok culture which began around 1500 BC. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Kingdom, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa Kingdom during the 11th century, while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal to the Kingdom of Warri. The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. Through contact with Europeans, early harbour towns such as Calabar, Badagry and Bonny emerged along the coast after 1480, which did business in the transatlantic slave trade, among other things. Conflicts in the hinterland, such as the civil war in the Oyo Empire, meant that new enslaved people were constantly being ""supplied"". After 1804, Usman dan Fodio unified an immense territory in his jihad against the superior but quarrelling Hausa states of the north, which was stabilised by his successors as the ""Caliphate of Sokoto"". In its initial endeavour to stop the slave trade in West Africa, the United Kingdom gradually expanded its sphere of influence after 1851, starting from the tiny island of Lagos (3 km2) and the port city of Calabar. The British followed expansive trading companies such as the RNC and missionaries such as Mary Slessor, who advanced into the hinterland, preached and founded missionary schools, but also took action against local customs such as the religiously induced killing of twins or servants of deceased village elders and against the Trial by ordeal as a means of establishing the legal truth. At the Berlin Congo Conference in 1885, the European powers demarcated their spheres of interest in Africa without regard to ethnic or linguistic boundaries and without giving those affected a say. Thereafter, the British made increasing advances in the Niger region, which they had negotiated in Berlin, and ultimately defeated the Sokoto Caliphate. From 1903, Great Britain controlled almost the entire present-day territory of Nigeria, which was united under a single administration in 1914 (in 1919, a border strip of the former German colony of Cameroon was added to the territory of Nigeria).

The Nok people and the Gajiganna people may have migrated from the Central Sahara, along with pearl millet and pottery, and diverged prior to arriving in the northern region of modern-day Nigeria. This may have led to their respective settlements in the regions of Gajiganna and Nok. Nok people may have also migrated from the West African Sahel to the region of Nok. Nok culture may have emerged in 1500 BCE and continued to persist until 1 BCE. Nok people may have developed terracotta sculptures, through large-scale economic production, as part of a complex funerary culture that may have included practices such as feasting. The earliest Nok terracotta sculptures may have developed in 900 BCE. Some Nok terracotta sculptures portray figures wielding slingshots, as well as bows and arrows, which may be indicative of Nok people engaging in the hunting, or trapping, of undomesticated animals. A Nok sculpture portrays two individuals, along with their goods, in a dugout canoe. Both of the anthropomorphic figures in the watercraft are paddling. The Nok terracotta depiction of a dugout canoe may indicate that Nok people used dugout canoes to transport cargo, along tributaries (e.g., Gurara River) of the Niger River, and exchanged them in a regional trade network. The Nok terracotta depiction of a figure with a seashell on its head may indicate that the span of these riverine trade routes may have extended to the Atlantic coast. In the maritime history of Africa, there is the earlier Dufuna canoe, which was constructed approximately 8000 years ago in the northern region of Nigeria; as the second earliest form of water vessel known in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Nok terracotta depiction of a dugout canoe was created in the central region of Nigeria during the first millennium BCE. As part of Nok traditional medicine, Nok ceramics may have been used to process roots and bark as medicinal plants for the production of medicinal decoctions. Excluding ancient Egyptian figurative art, Nok sculptures are regarded to be the earliest examples of large three-dimensional (sculptural) figurative art in continental Africa.

Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, and Biafra by Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka ""Emeka"" Odumegwu Ojukwu. The conflict resulted from political, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded the United Kingdom's formal decolonisation of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included a military coup, a counter-coup, and anti-Igbo pogroms in the Northern Region. The pogroms and the exodus of surviving Igbos from the Northern Region to the Igbo homelands in the Eastern Region led the leadership of the Eastern Region (whose population was two-thirds Igbo) to conclude that the Nigerian federal government would not protect them and that they must protect themselves in an independent Biafra. Within a year, Nigerian government troops surrounded Biafra, and captured coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. A blockade was imposed as a deliberate policy during the ensuing stalemate which led to the mass starvation of Biafran civilians. During the 2+1⁄2 years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.",Nigerian Civil War | Biafra | Civil wars in Nigeria | Civil wars of the 20th century | Coup-based civil wars | Ethnicity-based civil wars | Separatist rebellion-based civil wars | Wars involving Igboland,"1963, 1967, 1960, 1966, 1970",Background | Ethnic division | Politics and economics of federalism | Independence and First Republic | Military coups | Persecution of Igbo | Breakaway | War,"Date: Date6 July 1967 – 15 January 1970(2 years, 6 months, 1 week and 2 days)LocationSoutheastern NigeriaResult

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biafra,Biafra,Nigerian civil war Biafra,"Biafara anglicized as Biafra (/biˈæfərə/ /ˌbiːə-ˈfɑː-rə/), officially the Republic of Biafra, was a partially recognised state in West Africa that declared independence from Nigeria and existed from 1967 to 1970. Its territory consisted of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, predominantly inhabited by the Igbo ethnic group. Biafra was established on 30 May 1967 by Igbo military officer and Eastern Region governor Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu under his presidency, following a series of ethnic tensions and military coups after Nigerian independence in 1960 that culminated in the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom. The Nigerian military attempted to reclaim the territory of Biafra, resulting in the start of the Nigerian Civil War. Biafra was officially recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania, and Zambia while receiving de facto recognition and covert military support from France, Portugal, Israel, South Africa and Rhodesia. After nearly three years of war, during which around two million Biafran civilians died, president Ojukwu fled into exile in Ivory Coast as the Nigerian military approached the capital of Biafra. Philip Effiong became the second president of Biafra, and he oversaw the surrender of Biafran forces to Nigeria. Igbo nationalism became a strong political and social force after the civil war. It has grown more militant since the 1990s, calling for the independence of the Biafran people and the establishment of their state. Various Biafran secessionist groups have emerged, such as the Indigenous People of Biafra, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, and the Biafra Zionist Front. Early modern maps of Africa from the 15th to the 19th centuries, drawn from accounts written by explorers and travellers, show references to Biafar, Biafara, Biafra, and Biafares. According to the maps, the European travellers used the word Biafara to describe the region of today's West Cameroon, including an area around today's Equatorial Guinea. The German publisher Johann Heinrich Zedler, in his encyclopedia of 1731, published the exact geographical location of the capital of Biafara, namely alongside the river Rio dos Camaroes in today's Cameroon, underneath 6 degrees 10 min latitude. The words Biafara and Biafares also appear on maps from the 18th century in the area around Senegal and Gambia.",Biafra | 1967 establishments in Nigeria | 1970 disestablishments in Nigeria | Former territorial entities in Africa | Former countries in Africa | Former republics | Former unrecognized countries | History of Igboland,"1967, 1960, 1966, 1731, 1970",History | Under independent Nigeria | Nigerian civil war | Geography | Languages | Politics | International recognition | Economy,Status: Partially recognised state,2355,2025-06-22 19:36:13
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Biafra,Blockade of Biafra,Nigerian civil war Biafra,"The blockade of Biafra by the Nigerian federal government during the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970) resulted in a famine that ultimately cost at least a million lives and ended with the capitulation of the secessionist state of Biafra. The blockade and the ensuing humanitarian crisis stimulated worldwide mobilization and widespread debate about the concept of genocide. It also stimulated widespread debate about whether or not it was appropriate to describe the events which occurred in Biafra as a genocide. Ultimately, it contributed to reform in the law of blockade to protect civilians and the prohibition of starvation as a method of warfare in the 1977 amendments to the Geneva Conventions. In the aftermath of the 1966 Nigerian counter-coup, anti-Igbo pogroms erupted across northern Nigeria, killing thousands of Igbos. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu declared the independence of Biafra in the Igbo-populated areas of Nigeria in 1967, and the federal government led by Yakubu Gowon launched a civil war against the secessionist entity. During the first weeks of the war, the Nigerian government decided to impose a blockade of Biafra. Access to the secessionist republic through foreign currency transactions, mail and telecommunications, and all seaports and airfields was to be cut off. Initially it was unclear whether the blockade of the 200 miles (320 km) coast would be effective with the ships available to the Nigerian Navy, and whether the Nigerian Air Force would be able to interdict the air routes. Nevertheless, the blockade was effective and maintained for the next two and a half years. The Nigerian government relied on international law to enforce the blockade, since at the time starvation as a weapon of war was not prohibited and all neutral countries were obliged to abide by an announced blockade. The Nigerian government threatened reactions against countries that disregarded the blockade and made an agreement with Cameroon to obstruct Biafra's land border. Some smugglers attempted blockade running but two ships were destroyed by the Nigerian navy. The blockade interdicted food, medicine, and other supplies needed by civilians. Nigerian federal leaders obstructed the passage of relief supplies and stated that starvation was a deliberate tactic of war, although also dismissing reports of famine as Biafran propaganda.",Biafran humanitarian crisis | Famines in Africa | Blockades | Man-made disasters in Africa | Genocide studies,"1967, 1966, 1970, 1977",Background | The blockade | International reactions | Legacy | References | Sources,,2356,2025-06-22 19:36:13
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_People_of_Biafra,Indigenous People of Biafra,Nigerian civil war Biafra,"The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is a separatist group in Nigeria that aims to restore the defunct Republic of Biafra, a country which seceded from Nigeria in 1967 prior to the Nigerian Civil War and was subsequently dissolved following its defeat in 1970. Since 2021, IPOB and other Biafran separatist groups have been fighting a low-level guerilla conflict in southeastern Nigeria against the Nigerian government. The group was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu who has been the leader and Uche Mefor, who served as the deputy leader. Kanu is known as a British political activist known for his advocacy of the contemporary Biafran independence movement. It was declared a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government in 2017 under the Nigerian Terrorism Act, the declaration was nullified by a High Court sitting in Enugu in 2023. But an Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal upheld the Federal Government’s 2017 proscription of IPOB as a terrorist group. As of May 2022, the United Kingdom started denying asylum to members of IPOB who allegedly engaged in human rights abuses, though the UK government clarified that IPOB had not been designated as a terrorist organisation. IPOB has criticized the Nigerian federal government for poor investment, political alienation, inequitable resource distribution, ethnic marginalization, and heavy military presence, extrajudicial killings in the South-Eastern, South-Central and parts of North-Central regions of the country. The organization rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and is now the largest Biafran independence organization by membership. In recent years, it has gained significant media attention for becoming a frequent target of political crackdowns by the Nigerian government. It also has numerous sites and communication channels. Biafra had previously existed as an Independent multi-ethnic Republic consisting of primarily the Igbo, to name a few and was declared by Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu for three years, 1967 through 1970. The federal government fought hard to preserve the Federal Republic of Nigeria and did not like the idea of an independent state of Biafra. The result of tensions between Biafra and the federal government resulted in the Nigerian civil war that went on for three years. There were an estimated one to 3.5 million deaths that were heavily civilian casualties caused by starvation and death on the side of Biafra.

Her music spanned styles including classical, folk, gospel, blues, jazz, R&B, and pop. Her piano playing was strongly influenced by baroque and classical music, especially Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice. The sixth of eight children born into a respected family in North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a local fund set up in her hometown, she enrolled at Allen High School for Girls, then spent a summer at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City, preparing to apply for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. She failed to gain admission to Curtis, which she attributed to racism, though staff have pointed out that only three of 72 students were successful that year. In 2003, just days before her death, the institute awarded her an honorary degree. Early in her career, to make a living, Simone played piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to ""Nina Simone"" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play ""the devil's music"" or so-called ""cocktail piano"". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. After making her debut with Little Girl Blue in 1958, she went on to record more than 40 albums up to 1974. She released her first and biggest hit single in the United States in 1959 with ""I Loves You, Porgy"", which peaked inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Simone became known for her work in the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, and she later left the United States and settled in France following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. She lived and performed in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. In 1991, Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You (taking the title from her famous 1965 album), and she continued to perform and attract audiences until her death.

It was first performed on stage in 1964 by Cy Grant on the UK tour. Nina Simone recorded ""Feeling Good"" for her 1965 album I Put a Spell on You. The song has also been covered by other famous artists, including American singer Sammy Davis Jr., English rock band Traffic, Canadian singer Michael Bublé, American jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, American singer and actor Brian Stokes Mitchell, British singer George Michael, English pop singer Tony Hadley, American band Eels, American musician and singer Joe Bonamassa, Irish musician and singer Eden, English rock band Muse, British blues rock band Black Cat Bones, American DJ and electronic music producer Bassnectar, American singer and musician Sophie B.

The show, directed by Newley, toured British provincial theatres, and was then taken to the US by theatre producer David Merrick. It opened on 16 May 1965 at the Shubert Theatre in New York City, where the role of ""the Negro"", who sings ""Feeling Good"", was taken by Gilbert Price. In the show, Price's character is asked to compete against the show's hero ""Cocky""; but, as ""Cocky"" and his master ""Sir"" argue over the rules of the game, ""the Negro"" reaches the centre of the stage and ""wins"", singing the song at his moment of triumph. It was described as a ""booming song of emancipation"", and a Billboard review said it was ""the kind of robust number that should have strong appeal"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G.,The Notorious B.I.G.,Notorious BIG Biggie,"Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or simply Biggie, was an American rapper. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting his lyrics' often grim content. His music was usually semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Wallace was the first artist to sign with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs's Bad Boy Records in 1993. That same year, he gained recognition for his guest appearances on other artists' singles. His debut studio album, Ready to Die (1994), received widespread critical acclaim and included signature tracks ""Juicy"" and ""Big Poppa"". This album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, helping to restore New York's prominence at a time when the West Coast was dominating the genre. In 1995, Wallace was named Rapper of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards. That same year, Wallace and his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A.—which included longtime friends like Lil' Kim—released their debut album, Conspiracy (1995). While working on his second album in 1995, he became embroiled in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. After Tupac Shakur was murdered in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, rumors circulated suggesting that criminal elements connected to the Bad Boy camp might have been involved, given Wallace's public feud with Shakur. In March 1997, six months after Shakur's death, Wallace was also killed in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles by an unknown assailant. Two weeks later, his second album, Life After Death (1997), was issued as a posthumous double album; it debuted atop the Billboard 200, yielded two Billboard Hot 100-number one singles: ""Hypnotize"" and ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" (featuring Puff Daddy and Mase), and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With two posthumous albums released, Wallace's certified U.S. sales exceed 28 million copies, including 21 million albums. Rolling Stone called him the ""greatest rapper that ever lived"", and, in 2015, Billboard named him the greatest rapper of all time. The Source magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue.

He was 24 years old. Prior to the event, Wallace promoted his second studio album Life After Death, and attended an after-party in Los Angeles instead of taking a scheduled trip to London. In 2007, Wallace's mother, Voletta Wallace; his widow, Faith Evans; and his children, T'yanna Jackson and Christopher Jordan ""CJ"" Wallace, filed a $400 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) alleging that corrupt officers were responsible for Wallace's death. Retired LAPD officer Greg Kading alleged that Suge Knight, the head of Death Row Records, orchestrated the murder in revenge for the September 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur in a similar drive-by shooting. Bloods member Wardell Fouse was named as the alleged shooter. Christopher Wallace traveled to Los Angeles, California, in February 1997 to promote his upcoming second studio album, Life After Death, and to film a music video for its lead single ""Hypnotize."" On March 5, he gave a radio interview to The Dog House on San Francisco's KYLD in which he stated that he had hired security because he feared for his safety. Wallace mentioned that he had done so not only because of the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip-hop feud and the murder of Tupac Shakur six months prior, but because security was simply a necessity for high-profile celebrities. Life After Death was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997. On March 7, Wallace presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 1997 Soul Train Music Awards and was booed by some of the audience. The next morning, he was scheduled to travel to London. Instead, on the evening of March 8, he and the Bad Boy Records entourage attended an after-party hosted by Vibe magazine, Qwest Records and Tanqueray Gin at the Petersen Automotive Museum in the Carthay Circle neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_pyramids,Nubian pyramids,Nubian kingdoms Sudan,"The Nubian pyramids were constructed by the rulers of the ancient Kushite kingdoms in the region of the Nile Valley known as Nubia, located in present-day northern Sudan. This area was the site of three ancient Kushite kingdoms. The capital of the first was at Kerma (2500–1500 BC), the second was centered on Napata (1000–300 BC) and the third was centered on Meroë (300 BC – 300 AD). In Nubian culture, the pyramids were integral to burial customs for royalty and other wealthy figures of the Kushite kingdom, with this practice starting as early as the 7th century BC. These customs endured for almost a thousand years from 700 BC to 350 AD. The Nubian pyramids display adaptations of Egyptian architecture that were prevalent during the New Kingdom. Notably these are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Nubian pyramids were built over a period of a few hundred years to serve as tombs for the kings and queens and wealthy citizens of Napata and Meroë. The four main sites in which these pyramids hold prominence are El-Kurru, Nuri, Jebel Barkal, and Meroe. The first three sites are located around Napata in Lower Nubia, near the modern town of Karima. The earliest pyramids in El Kurru were constructed in 751 BC, which formed the center of the Empire of Kush during the Napatan period, ca. 850-300 BC. It is recognized as the origin of the tombs belonging to the rulers of Egypt and Nubia's 25th Dynasty, c. 750–664 BC, along with their ancestors. The tradition of building royal Kushite pyramids is believed to have originated from King Piankhy. This burial tradition was continued by Piye's successor Shabataka, Shabaka. and Tanwetamani. Later these pyramids begin to be built 26 kilometers upstream from El-Kurru at the site of Nuri which contains burials from 670-310 BC. The earliest burial at Nuri is accredited to King Taharqo who ruled from 690–664 BC. The oldest and largest pyramid at Nuri–and in all of Nubia–is that of the Napatan king and Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaoh Taharqa. His tomb, standing at 160–180 feet tall, differed from other Nubian pyramids in the manner that it mirrored the tomb of Osiris, an Egyptian pyramid. The pyramid was built on the left bank of the Nile, typically the west bank representing sunset and death. However, due to the bend of the Nile at Nuri, the left bank is actually the east bank representing sunrise and rebirth. In this way, the tomb was used to associate Taharqa's passing with new beginnings and rebirth, paving the way to a new golden age",Archaeological sites in Sudan | History of Nubia | Kingdom of Kush | Nubian architecture | Pyramids in Sudan,"1500, 1000",Chronology and organization of Nubian burial sites | Burial methods and architecture | Key distinctions between Egyptian and Nubian pyramids | Notable figures and their discoveries | Pyramids and cemeteries | See also | Explanatory notes | References,Alternative name: Nubian pyramids | Location: Sudan | Coordinates: 16°56′15″N 33°44′55″E﻿ / ﻿16.93750°N 33.74861°E﻿ / 16.93750; 33.74861 | Type: Pyramids | Founded: 800 BC – 100 AD,2771,2025-06-22 19:35:17
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubians,Nubians,Nubian kingdoms Sudan,"Nubians (/ˈnuːbiənz, ˈnjuː-/) (Nobiin: Nobī; Arabic: النوبيون) are a Nilo-Saharan speaking ethnic group indigenous to the region which is now northern Sudan and southern Egypt. They originate from the early inhabitants of the central Nile valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradles of civilization. In the southern valley of Egypt, Nubians differ culturally and ethnically from Egyptians, although they intermarried with members of other ethnic groups, especially Arabs. They speak Nubian languages as a mother tongue, part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages, and Arabic as a second language. Neolithic settlements have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley. Parts of Nubia, particularly Lower Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Meroë or the Kingdom of Kush. By the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (744 BC–656 BC), all of Egypt was united with Nubia, extending down to what is now Khartoum. However, in 656 BC, the native Twenty-sixth Dynasty regained control of Egypt. As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow. In the Middle Ages, the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, Makuria in the center, and Alodia in the south. They then converted to Islam during the Islamization of the Sudan region. Today, Nubians in Egypt primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in Kom Ombo and Nasr al-Nuba (Arabic: نصر النوبة) north of Aswan, and large cities such as Cairo, while Sudanese Nubians live in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egypt–Sudan border and al Dabbah. Some Nubians were forcibly moved to Khashm el Girba and New Halfa upon the construction of the High Dam in Egypt which flooded their ancestral lands. Additionally, a group known as the Midob live in northern Darfur, a group named Birgid in Central Darfur and several groups known as the Hill Nubians who live in Northern Kordofan in Haraza and a few villages in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state. The main Nile Nubian groups from north to south are the Kenzi (Kenzi/Mattokki-speaking), Faddicca (Nobiin-speaking), Halfawi (Nobiin-speaking), Sukkot (Nobiin-speaking), Mahas (Nobiin-speaking), and Danagla (Andaandi-speaking).",Nubia | Indigenous peoples of East Africa | Indigenous peoples of North Africa | Ethnic groups in Sudan | Ethnic groups in Egypt | Ancient peoples of Africa | Muslim communities in Africa,,Etymology | History | Language | Nubian Greeks | Axumite subjugation of Nubia | Nubian Greek society | Modern Nubians | Culture,"Sudan: 167,831 (1956 census)[1]

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sudan,History of Sudan,Nubian kingdoms Sudan,"The history of Sudan refers to the territory that today makes up Republic of the Sudan and the state of South Sudan, which became independent in 2011. The territory of Sudan is geographically part of a larger African region, also known as ""Sudan"". The term is derived from Arabic: بلاد السودان bilād as-sūdān, or ""land of the black people"", and has sometimes been used more widely referring to the Sahel belt of West and Central Africa. The modern Republic of the Sudan was formed in early 1956 and inherited its boundaries from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, established in 1899. For times predating 1899, usage of the term ""Sudan"" mainly applied to the Turkish Sudan and the Mahdist State, and a wider and changing territory between Egypt in the North and regions in the South adjacent to modern Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. The early history of the Kingdom of Kush, located along the Nile region in northern Sudan, is intertwined with the history of ancient Egypt, with which it was politically allied over several regnal eras. By virtue of its proximity to Egypt, Sudan participated in the wider history of the Near East, with the important 25th dynasty of Egypt and the Christianization of the three Nubian kingdoms Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia in the sixth century. As a result of Christianization, the Old Nubian language stands as the oldest recorded Nilo-Saharan language (earliest records dating to the eighth century in an adaptation of the Coptic alphabet). While Islam was already present on the Sudanese Red Sea coast and the adjacent territories since the 7th century, the Nile Valley did not undergo Islamization until the 14th-15th century, following the decline of the Christian kingdoms. These kingdoms were succeeded by the Sultanate of Sennar in the early 16th century, which controlled large parts of the Nile Valley and the Eastern Desert, while the kingdoms of Darfur controlled the western part of Sudan. Two small kingdoms arose in the southern regions, the Shilluk Kingdom of 1490, and Taqali of 1750, near modern-day South Sudan, but both northern and southern regions were seized by Muhammad Ali of Egypt during the 1820s. The oppressive rule of Muhammad Ali and his immediate successors is credited for stirring up resentment against the Turco-Egyptian and British rulers and led to the establishment of the Mahdist State, founded by Muhammad Ahmad in 1881.",History of Sudan,"1956, 1490, 1750, 1899, 2011, 1881",Prehistory | Nile Valley | Eastern Sudan | Antiquity | Kingdom of Kush | Meroë | Medieval Nubia (c. 350–1500) | Islamic kingdoms (c. 1500–1821),,2377,2025-06-22 19:35:19
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_languages,Nubian languages,Nubian kingdoms Sudan,"The Nubian languages are a group of related languages spoken by the Nubians. Nubian languages were spoken throughout much of Sudan, but as a result of Arabization they are today mostly limited to the Nile Valley between Aswan (southern Egypt) and Al Dabbah. In the 1956 Census of Sudan there were 167,831 speakers of Nubian languages. Nubian is not to be confused with the various Nuba languages spoken in villages in the Nuba mountains and Darfur. More recent classifications, such as those in Glottolog, consider that Nubian languages form a primary language family. Older classifications consider Nubian to be a branch of the Nilo-Saharan phylum, a proposal that has low support among linguists due to a lack of supporting data. Old Nubian is preserved in at least a hundred pages of documents, comprising both texts of a Christian religious nature and documentary texts dealing with state and legal affairs. Old Nubian was written with a slanted uncial variety of the Coptic alphabet, with the addition of characters derived from Meroitic. These documents range in date from the 8th to the 15th century AD. Old Nubian is currently considered ancestral to modern Nobiin, even though it shows signs of extensive contact with Dongolawi. Another, as yet undeciphered, Nubian language has been preserved in a few inscriptions found in Soba and Musawwarat es-Sufra and is assumed to have been the language of the kingdom of Alodia. Since their publication by Adolf Ermann in 1881, they have been referred to as 'Alwan inscriptions', 'Alwan Nubian or 'Soba Nubian'. This language appears to have become extinct by the 19th century. A reconstruction of Proto-Nubian has been proposed by Claude Rilly (2010: 272–273).",Nubian languages | Nubia | Language families | Languages of Egypt | Languages of Sudan | Northern Eastern Sudanic languages,"1956, 2010, 1881",History | Present-day languages | Classification | Orthography | See also | References | Sources | External links,"Geographicdistribution: Egypt, Sudan | Ethnicity: Nubian | Native speakers: 200,000–1 million

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia,Nubia,Nubian kingdoms Sudan,"Nubia (/ˈnjuːbiə/, Nobiin: Nobīn, Arabic: النُوبَة, romanized: an-Nūba) is a region along the Nile river encompassing the area between the confluence of the Blue and White Niles (in Khartoum in central Sudan), and the first cataract of the Nile (south of Aswan in southern Egypt) or more strictly, Al Dabbah. It was the seat of one of the earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, the Kerma culture, which lasted from around 2500 BC until its conquest by the New Kingdom of Egypt under Pharaoh Thutmose I around 1500 BC, whose heirs ruled most of Nubia for the next 400 years. Nubia was home to several empires, most prominently the Kingdom of Kush, which conquered Egypt in the eighth century BC during the reign of Piye and ruled the country as its 25th Dynasty. From the 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD, northern Nubia was invaded and annexed to Egypt, ruled by the Greeks and Romans. This territory was known in the Greco-Roman world as Dodekaschoinos. Kush's collapse in the fourth century AD was preceded by an invasion from the Ethiopian Kingdom of Aksum and the rise of three Christian kingdoms: Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. Makuria and Alodia lasted for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline started not only the partition of Nubia, which was split into the northern half conquered by the Ottomans and the southern half by the Sennar sultanate, in the sixteenth century, but also a rapid Islamization and partial Arabization of the Nubian people. Nubia was reunited with the Khedivate of Egypt in the nineteenth century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan. The primarily archaeological science dealing with ancient Nubia is called Nubiology. Historically, the people of Nubia spoke at least two varieties of Nubian languages, a subfamily that includes Nobiin (the descendant of Old Nubian), Dongolawi, Midob and several related varieties in the northern part of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan. The Birgid language was spoken north of Nyala in Darfur, but became extinct as late as 1970. However, the linguistic identity of the ancient Kerma culture of southern and central Nubia (also known as Upper Nubia), is uncertain; some research suggests that it belonged to the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages, while more recent studies indicate that the Kerma culture belonged to the Eastern Sudanic branch of Nilo-Saharan languages instead, and that other peoples of northern or Lower Nubia north of Kerma (such as the C-Group culture and the Ble",Nubia | History of Nubia | Ancient peoples | Historical regions | Ancient Greek geography of East Africa | Regions of Africa | Regions of Egypt | 5th-millennium BC establishments,"1500, 1970",Linguistics | Geography | History | Prehistory (before 6000–3500 BC) | Pre-Kerma; A-Group (3500-3000 BC) | Early Kerma (3000–2400 BC) | Early Kerma; C-Group (2400–1550 BC) | Kerma; Egyptian Empire (1550–1100 BC),,2608,2025-06-22 19:35:21
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism,Pan-Africanism,Pan-Africanism history,"Pan-Africanism is a nationalist movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous peoples and diasporas of African ancestry. Based on a common goal dating back to the Atlantic slave trade, the Trans-Saharan slave trade, the Indian Ocean slave trade, the Red Sea slave trade, slavery in the Cape Colony (now South Africa), along with slavery in Mauritius, the movement extends beyond continental Africans with a substantial support base among the African diaspora in the Americas and Europe. Pan-Africanism is said to have its origins in the struggles of the African people against enslavement and colonization and this struggle may be traced back to the first resistance on slave ships—rebellions and suicides—through the constant plantation and colonial uprisings and the ""Back to Africa"" movements of the 19th century. Based on the belief that unity is vital to economic, social, and political progress, it aims to unify and uplift people of African ancestry. However, it was in the twentieth century that Pan Africanism emerged as a distinct political movement initially formed and led by people from the Diaspora (people of African heritage living outside of the Continent). In 1900, the Trinindadian barrister – Henry Sylvester Williams – called a conference that took place in Westminster Hall, London to ""protest stealing of lands in the colonies, racial discrimination and deal with other issues of interest to Blacks"". At its core, Pan-Africanism is a belief that ""African people, both on the continent and in the diaspora, share not merely a common history, but a common destiny."" Pan-Africanism posits a sense of a shared historical fate for Africans in the Americas, the West Indies, and on the continent, itself centered on the Atlantic trade in slaves, African slavery, and European imperialism. Pan-African thought influenced the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (since succeeded by the African Union) in 1963.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_colours,Pan-African colours,Pan-Africanism history,"Pan-African colours is a term that may refer to two different sets of colours: Green, yellow, and red are now found on the national flags of many African nations. The colour combination was borrowed from the flag of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian flag has influenced the flags of many Pan-African organizations and polities. Except for relatively brief periods of influence and occupation by the Kingdom of Italy, Ethiopia remained outside European control during the colonial era by defeating the Italian army at the battle of Adwa in 1896, ending the Italian protectorate. As a result, the country drew the admiration of many newly independent states in Africa. The adoption of the Ethiopian national colours by many Pan-African entities is a consequence of this. The first African state to adopt a gold, red and green flag upon independence was Ghana in 1957, designed by Theodosia Okoh. The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) founded by Marcus Garvey has a constitution that defines red, black, and green as the Pan-African colours: ""red representing the noble blood that unites all people of African ancestry, the colour black for the people, green for the rich land of Africa.""[citation needed] The UNIA flag was designated the official colours of Black Africans by the UNIA at its convention in Madison Square Garden on August 13, 1920, in New York City, United States.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-African_flag,Pan-African flag,Pan-Africanism history,"The pan-African flag (also known as the Afro-American flag, Black Liberation flag, UNIA flag, and various other names) is an ethnic flag representing pan-Africanism, the African diaspora, and/or black nationalism. A tri-color flag, it consists of three equal horizontal bands of (from top down) red, black, and green. The flag was likely influenced by the older Pan-African colors, substituting yellow for black to promote racial pride. The flag was created as a response to racism against African Americans in 1920 with the help of Marcus Garvey. The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) formally adopted it on August 13, 1920, in Article 39 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World, during its month-long convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Variations of the flag can and have been used in various countries and territories in the Americas to represent Garveyist ideologies. The flag was created in 1920 by members of UNIA in response to the ""coon song"" that became a hit around 1900, titled, ""Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon"". This song has been cited as one of the three songs that ""firmly established the term coon in the American vocabulary"". In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the Negro World weekly newspaper, Marcus Garvey was quoted as saying: Show me the race or the nation without a flag, and I will show you a race of people without any pride. Aye! In song and mimicry they have said, ""Every race has a flag but the coon."" How true! Aye! But that was said of us four years ago. They can't say it now. ...

The Pan-African Congress first gained a reputation as a peacemaker for decolonization in Africa and in the West Indies, and made a significant advance for the Pan-African cause. In the beginning, one of the group's major demands was to end colonial rule and racial discrimination. It stood against imperialism and it demanded human rights and equality of economic opportunity. The manifesto given by the Pan-African Congress included the political and economic demands of the Congress for a new world context of international cooperation and the need to address the issues facing Africa as a result of European colonization of most of the continent. Congresses have taken place in 1919 in Paris; 1921 in Brussels, London and Paris; 1923 in Lisbon and London; 1927 in New York City; 1945 in Manchester; 1974 in Dar es Salaam; 1994 in Kampala; and 2014 in Johannesburg. Pan Africanism as a philosophy was created as early as the late 1700s, seen through the movements of abolition in both the United States and Britain. British writers and former slaves, Ottobah Cugoano and Olaudah Equiano created the foundations for Pan Africanism in English literature. French speakers, like Léopold Sédar Senghor, created the idea of Négritude. These ideas refuted the inferiority of Black people. Pan Africanists believed that both slavery and colonialism were built on negative attitudes towards people of African descent, which in turn, contributed to racism.

The heights of the movement is primarily characterized in the west by the black nationalist struggles of Marcus Garvey, and the push for greater self determination by W.E.B Du Bois during the early twentieth century. The literature is much vaster once one leaves the western world and enters the African continent, where one can find a consistent effort in much of the territory to unify themselves against the common enemy of Imperialism. Pan-Africanism's influence can be characterized through its contributions to art, media, and politics. Harry Thuku was a prominent speaker born in the Kikuyu region whose prominence can be traced all the way back to the 1910s. He worked with Ugandans and other Africans to expand their strength and expose the unfair economic and social conditions levied onto them by Britain. Harry Thuku proved himself a pioneer of pushing for African-Asian alliances with his positions on Indian migration within the still colonial Kenyan. Here, in the African political realm, one is introduced to famous fathers of Pan-Africanism like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso, and Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria. These pioneers would push Pan-Africa well into the 1960s while sparking a whole generation of new cultural and political movements along the way.... Amongst the famous persons is Jomo Kenyatta, who would spearhead Kenya into independence and the nation's first experiment with democracy. Despite Pan-Africanism in Kenya, dating back to the 1920s with Harry Thuku, it would be Kenyatta who would actualize the movement's real potential in Kenya. Pan-Africanism cannot be studied in Kenya without realizing Jomo Kenyatta's dream for Kenya's role in leading the African world. Jomo Kenyatta, born Kamau Ngeni, was born in the Gatundu Division of Kiambu in 1889 to the Kikuyu tribe. Kenyatta was introduced to Kenyan politics by way of his occupation at the Nairobi City Council from 1921 to 1926.

François' father Patrice Lumumba was the first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but he was overthrown and murdered during the Congo Crisis. Already studying in Egypt for his own safety at the time of the assassination, François Lumumba spent the next decades in exile. He became a leading figure and eventually the party leader of a major faction of the MNC-L, the party of his father. In this position, he attempted to unite various exiled opposition groups and to support rebellions against the Congoloese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. After Mobutu's downfall in the 1990s, Lumumba returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to participate in democratic politics and support efforts to stop the Second Congo War. He has achieved little success in national politics. François Lumumba was born to Patrice Lumumba and Pauline Kie in Stanleyville (modern Kisangani), Congo, on 20 September 1951. At the time, the Congo was a Belgian colony. François' family situation was complex. His father Patrice was married three times, and his first two marriages had produced no children and had been divorced by the time of François' birth. By 1947, Patrice began an extramarital affair with Kie, and they lived together in Stanleyville from 1948. Though this relationship proved to be very close and durable, they never married. Instead, Lumumba requested his friends and family to arrange a new marriage with a girl from his home region in 1951. As it turned out, however, Kie was already pregnant by this time; soon after François' birth, his parents were forced to end their affair due to the arrival of Patrice's third wife, Pauline Opango, in Stanleyville. Regardless, Patrice continued to stay in touch with his former girlfriend and eldest son, supporting the two with money. Patrice Lumumba's continuing contacts with Kie were a major source of strife within the family. Despite Opango's disapproval, Patrice officially acknowledged François as his son, doing so at a time when Opango was visiting her parents in her home village in order to circumvent having to get her legal agreement. When he reached school-going age, François began to live with his father's family. Patrice –who strongly favored modern education– sent François to a local Eu",1951 births | Democratic Republic of the Congo rebels | People of the Congo Crisis | Mouvement National Congolais politicians | Living people | Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies alumni,"1951, 1967, 1948, 1960, 1970, 1947, 1957",Biography | Early life | Political activity | Family | Notes | References | Works cited,"Born: (1951-09-20) 20 September 1951 (age 73)Stanleyville, Belgian Congo",4068,2025-06-22 19:39:52

He was the leader of the Congolese National Movement (MNC) from 1958 until his assassination in 1961. Ideologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic. Shortly after Congolese independence in June 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo Crisis. After a coup, Lumumba attempted to escape to Stanleyville to join his supporters who had established a new anti-Mobutu state called the Free Republic of the Congo. Lumumba was captured en route by state authorities under Joseph-Désiré Mobutu (Sese Seko), sent to the State of Katanga and, with the help of Belgian mercenaries, tortured and executed by the separatist Katangan authorities of Moïse Tshombe. In 2002, Belgium formally apologised for its role in the execution, admitting ""moral responsibility"", and in 2022, they returned Lumumba’s tooth to his family. He is seen as a martyr for the pan-African movement. Patrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 as Isaïe Tasumbu Tawosa to Julienne Wamato Lomendja and her husband, François Tolenga Otetshima, a farmer, in Onalua, in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo. He was a member of the Tetela ethnic group, where he was referred to with the name Élias Okit'Asombo. His original surname means ""heir of the cursed"" and is derived from the Tetela words okitá/okitɔ́ ('heir', 'successor') and asombó ('cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly'). He had three brothers (Charles Lokolonga, Émile Kalema, and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother (Jean Tolenga). Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, where he passed the one-year course with distinction. He was known for being a vocal, precocious young man, regularly pointing out the errors of his teachers in front of his peers. This outspoken nature would come to define his life and career.

He was known for his stand-up comedy career and his regular guest appearances on the talk show Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn and the radio show Opie and Anthony. O'Neal began performing stand-up in 1992 and developed an act based on conversations with the audience, deconstructive analysis, and occasionally confrontational points of view. From 2006 to 2008, he presented The Black Phillip Show on XM Satellite Radio. His only stand-up comedy special, Elephant in the Room (2011), was released nine months before his death at the age of 41 from a stroke caused by type 2 diabetes. A posthumous follow-up, Mr. P (2012), was released as audio only. Patrice Lumumba Malcolm O'Neal was born in New York City on December 7, 1969. He was named by his mother after Patrice Lumumba, leader of the Congolese independence movement and the Republic of the Congo's first prime minister, and the African-American human rights activist Malcolm X. He was bullied at school over his name, but later said that it taught him ""how to be a man"". He and his sister, Zinder, were raised by their mother in Boston's largely Black working class Roxbury neighborhood. O'Neal never had a relationship with his father, although he was aware of his identity. In his adolescence, Patrice has said that he was convicted of statutory rape of a girl who was one year younger than him, and he spent a summer in prison. O'Neal attended West Roxbury High School, during which he took up football and ended his playing career with three varsity letter awards and winning a state championship in his senior year. He turned down a sports scholarship at Northeastern University in Boston, which included a housing grant, in favor of studying performing arts at the university with a major in theater studies. His interest in comedy had grown by this time, and he took up work as a bouncer at the Comedy Connection in Boston.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congolese_Independence_Speech,Congolese Independence Speech,Patrice Lumumba Congo,"Congolese: The Speech at the Ceremony of the Proclamation of the Congo's Independence[a] was a short political speech given by Patrice Lumumba on 30 June 1960 at the ceremonies marking the independence of the Republic of Congo (the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) from Belgium. It is best known for its outspoken criticism of colonialism. Lumumba, the first Congolese Prime Minister, gave the address during the official independence commemorations at the Palais de la Nation in Léopoldville (modern-day Kinshasa). The ceremony was intended to mark the harmonious end of Belgian rule and was attended by both Congolese and Belgian dignitaries, including King Baudouin. Lumumba's speech, which was itself unscheduled, was in large part a response to Baudouin's speech in which the end of colonial rule in the Congo had been depicted as the culmination of the Belgian ""civilising mission"" begun by Leopold II in the Congo Free State. Lumumba's speech, broadcast live on the radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude at a time when Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium, and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone. The speech itself has since been praised for its use of political rhetoric, and is considered a landmark moment in the independence of the Congo. It has also been cited as a contributary factor to the subsequent Congo Crisis and in Lumumba's murder in 1961. Since its delivery, the speech has been widely reprinted and has been depicted in paintings and film.",Political history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo | 1960 in the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) | 1960 in Belgium | Cold War speeches | Speeches about colonialism | Decolonisation of Africa | June 1960 in Africa | 1960 speeches,"1961, 1960",Background | The speech | Background and context | Content | Analysis | Reception | Legacy | See also,,1834,2025-06-22 19:39:55
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician),Prince (musician),Prince musician,"Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation, Prince was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona, wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams, and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, disco, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 18, soon releasing the studio albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). In 1984, Prince became the first singer to simultaneously have a number-one film, album and single in the US, with the film Purple Rain, its soundtrack and his first Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single ""When Doves Cry"". The album, recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, spent six consecutive months atop the US Billboard 200 chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. The movie grossed $70.3 million worldwide and it has been regarded as one of the greatest musical films. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol (known to fans as the ""Love Symbol"") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist. After moving to Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos.

It was released on October 19, 1979, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was written, arranged, composed, produced and performed entirely by Prince. Overall, Prince was regarded as more diverse than For You (1978), and performed better critically and commercially. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: ""This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it"". Prince peaked at 22 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard R&B Chart.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_rhythm_and_blues,New Orleans rhythm and blues,R&B rhythm and blues,"New Orleans rhythm and blues is a style of rhythm and blues that originated in New Orleans. It was a direct precursor to rock and roll and strongly influenced ska. Instrumentation typically includes drums, bass, piano, horns, electric guitar, and vocals. The style is characterized by syncopated ""second line"" rhythms, a strong backbeat, and soulful vocals. Artists such as Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, and Fats Domino are representative of the New Orleans R&B sound. New Orleans rhythm and blues can be characterized by predominant piano, ""singing"" horns, and call-and-response elements. Clear influences of Kansas City Swing bands can be heard through the extensive use of trumpet and saxophone solos. A ""double"" bass line, when the guitar and bass play in unison, was combined with a strong backbeat to make the music easy to dance to. It is also common to hear the influence of Caribbean rhythms such as the mambo, rhumba, and the calypso. In addition, the usage of blue notes is characteristic. Like most blues, New Orleans R&B typically follows a standard three-stanza form that contains tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. Within these chords, the three ""blue notes"", also known as flatted notes, are the third, fifth, and seventh scale degrees. In New Orleans R&B, the flatted third is particularly notable. New Orleans rhythm and blues was pioneered by local barrelhouse pianists Champion Jack Dupree, Archibald, and Professor Longhair. Professor Longhair, otherwise known as ""Fess"", was considerably influential in the development of the New Orleans R&B sound. Allen Toussaint, an important figure in New Orleans R&B, described him as ""The Bach of Rock 'n' Roll"". He combined Caribbean and boogie-woogie rhythms to create his signature style. The result was a usage of polyrhythms that he often whistled while playing. Although he was admired by other New Orleans musicians, he did not gain national attention until the end of his career.",Blues music genres | Music of New Orleans | Music of Louisiana | Rhythm and blues,,Characteristics | Early pioneers | Professors and barrelhouse pianists | Popular artists | Roy Brown | Dave Bartholomew | Paul Gayten | Smiley Lewis,"Stylistic origins: Louisiana musicrhythm and blues | Cultural origins: New Orleans, United States",1953,2025-06-22 19:33:28
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B,Contemporary R&B,R&B rhythm and blues,"Contemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre, originating from African-American musicians in the 1970s that combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music. According to Geoffrey Himes speaking in 1989, the progressive soul movement of the early 1970s ""expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since"". This movement was led by soul singers, songwriters and producers such as Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. Norman Whitfield's productions at Motown, the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple hooks of earlier rhythm and blues records against strong backbeats, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the texture of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as What's Going On (1971) incorporated jazz influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction. The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the disco era in the late 1970s, when Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style. The first result was Off the Wall (1979), which—according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic—""was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus"" and ""was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk"".",Contemporary R&B | 1980s in music | 1990s in music | 2000s in music | 2010s in music | 2020s in music | African-American music | American styles of music,"1971, 1989, 1979",Precursors | 1990s | 2000s | 2010s | 2020s | See also | References | Further reading,"Stylistic origins: Rhythm and bluespopsoulfunkhip hopelectronic | Cultural origins: Late 1970s and early 1980s, North America | Derivative forms: Neo soulnu-funk2-stepalternative R&Bafroswing",1986,2025-06-22 19:33:29
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_rhythm_and_blues,British rhythm and blues,R&B rhythm and blues,"British rhythm and blues (or R&B) was a musical movement that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy. The origins of the movement were in the British jazz, skiffle and folk movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner to turn to electric blues and form the band Blues Incorporated, which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included the Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, the Animals, the Yardbirds, Them, and the Spencer Davis Group, who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, in the wake of the Merseybeat craze, becoming central to the beatnik and mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US. Several of the bands and their members went on to become leading rock music performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, helping to create psychedelic, progressive and hard rock and making rhythm and blues a key component of that music. In the mid to late-1970s, British R&B enjoyed a revival through the British soul and disco scenes, the pub rock circuit, new wave music and the mod revival, and has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the late 1980s. In the 2000s, a British version of contemporary R&B began gaining popularity, and since the late 2000s the success of British female singers influenced by soul and R&B led to talk of another ""R&B British invasion"". Commentators often distinguish British rhythm and blues bands from beat bands (who were influenced by rock and roll and rockabilly) on the one hand, and, from ""purist"" British blues (which particularly emulated Chicago electric blues artists), on the other, although there was considerable crossover between the three sets of musicians. Merseybeat bands like the Beatles, or from the parallel beat scene in Manchester, were influenced by American forms of music that included rockabilly, girl groups and the early Motown sound, helping th",British rhythm and blues | 20th-century music genres | 21st-century music genres | Rhythm and blues genres | 1960s in music | British styles of music | British Invasion | Mod (subculture),"1964, 1958, 1963",Characteristics | History | Origins | Jazz | Skiffle | Folk | Development | Major acts,"Stylistic origins: Rhythm and bluesrock and rollBritish jazzskiffleBritish folk revival | Cultural origins: Late 1950s – early 1960s, United Kingdom | Derivative forms: Hard rockgarage rockBritish soulpsychedelic rockprogressive rockpub rock",2952,2025-06-22 19:33:30

The Billboard R&B chart is today known as the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. From May 22, 1948 to October 13, 1958, multiple charts were published, which explains the overlap in the dates of the charts. Previously, Harlem Hit Parade, created in 1942, had listed the “most popular records in Harlem"" and another chart, ""Race Records Juke Box"", was created in 1945; in 1948, a parallel chart was added: ""Race Record Best Sellers"". (The term ""race music"" originally came from within the black community, but was deemed offensive in the postwar world.) All of these were renamed as R&B charts in 1949. A third, ""Jockeys"" chart, based on radio airplay, was introduced in 1955, and a unified chart was only introduced in 1958. Because of the existence of multiple charts, some dates had more than one number-one song during the week. From November 30, 1963 to January 23, 1965 there was no Billboard R&B singles chart. Some publications have used Cashbox magazine's stats in their place. No specific reason has ever been given as to why Billboard ceased releasing R&B charts, but the prevailing wisdom is that the chart methodology used was being questioned, since more and more white acts were reaching number-one on the R&B chart. According to researcher Joel Whitburn, ""there was so much crossover of titles between the R&B and pop singles (Hot 100) charts that Billboard considered the charts to be too similar. This does not mean that R&B artists stopped turning out hits. After all, it was during this 14-month period that Motown established itself as an R&B institution.""",Lists of number-one R&B songs in the United States | Rhythm and blues,"1958, 1965, 1963, 1948, 1945, 1942, 1949, 1955",History | Gap in the chart | Chart names | List | References,,1641,2025-06-22 19:33:31
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop,Hip-hop,Rap music history,"Hip-hop or hip hop (originally disco rap) is a popular music genre that emerged in the early 1970s from the African-American community of New York City. The style is characterized by its synthesis of a wide range of musical techniques. Hip-hop includes rapping often enough that the terms can be used synonymously. However, ""hip-hop"" more properly denotes an entire subculture. Other key markers of the genre are the disc jockey, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre. It simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it. The hip-hop genre and culture emerged from block parties in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly Bronx. DJs began expanding the instrumental breaks of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended instrumental breaks provided a platform for break dancers and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were disco due to its popularity at the time. This disco-inflected music is known as old-school hip-hop. The genre became more stylistically diverse in the 1980s as electro music started to inform new-school hip-hop. The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as hip-hop's Golden age as the genre started to earn wide critical acclaim and generate massive sales. The popularity of hip-hop music expanded throughout the late 1990s and into the 21st century, where it became a worldwide phenomenon. Most countries have local variations on the style.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap,Gangsta rap,Rap music history,"Gangsta rap or gangster rap, initially called reality rap, is a subgenre of rap music that conveys the culture, values, and experiences of urban gangs and street hustlers, frequently discussing unpleasant realities of the world in general through an urban lens. Emerging in the late 1980s, gangsta rap's pioneers include Schoolly D and Ice-T, later expanding with artists such as N.W.A. In 1992, via record producer and rapper Dr. Dre, rapper Snoop Dogg, and their G-funk sound, gangster rap broadened to mainstream popularity. Gangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and drug dealing, as well as misogyny, promiscuity, and materialism. Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or police brutality, and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including Spike Lee, pastor Calvin Butts and activist C. Delores Tucker. Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D is generally considered the first ""gangsta rapper"", significantly influencing the more popular early gangsta rap originator, Ice-T. Ice-T was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1958. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles where he rose to prominence in the West Coast hip hop scene. An early case of using ""gangsta"" as an adjective and a compliment came in his 1984 single Body Rock. In 1986, Ice-T released ""6 in the Mornin'"", which is regarded as the second gangsta rap song. Ice-T had been MCing since the early 1980s, but first turned to gangsta rap themes after being influenced by Schoolly D's self-titled debut album, and especially the song ""P.S.K. What Does It Mean?"" (1985), which is regarded as the first gangsta rap song. Schoolly D had ""Am I Black Enough For You"" album in 1989. In an interview with PROPS magazine, Ice-T said: In 2011, Ice-T repeated in his autobiography that Schoolly D was his inspiration for gangsta rap. Ice-T continued to release gangsta albums for the remainder of the 1980s: Rhyme Pays in 1987, Power in 1988 and The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say in 1989. Ice-T's lyrics also contained strong political commentary, and often played the line between glorifying the gangsta lifestyle and criticizing it as a no-win situation.","Gangsta rap | Hip-hop genres | Criticism of hip-hop | Hardcore hip-hop | Music of New York City | Music of New York (state) | Music of California | Compton, California","1958, 1985, 1987, 2011, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1986, 1989",1985–1988: Early years | Schoolly D and Ice-T | Boogie Down Productions | Other early influences | 1989–1997: Golden age | N.W.A and Ice Cube | Ice-T's solo career | G-funk and Death Row Records,Stylistic origins: Hip-hophardcore hip-hoppolitical hip-hop | Cultural origins: Mid-1980sLos AngelesPhiladelphiaNew York,2468,2025-06-22 19:32:53

The series pits historical and pop culture figures against one another in a rap battle format. The characters portrayed are often determined by suggestions from viewers in the comments sections of the channel's videos. Shukoff and Ahlquist write each song themselves, researching the subject in order to find obscure details to use as references in the lyrics, although guest stars featured in the battles as well as certain Patreon subscribers have also contributed to the writing process. Following an extended hiatus, the channel returned with a bonus battle in December 2018, and the sixth season debuted on April 20, 2019. As of February 23, 2023, the channel has 14.9 million subscribers and approximately 4 billion total video views. The popularity of the music videos has led to mainstream partnerships, such as with Ubisoft, using the ""Blackbeard vs. Al Capone"" episode to promote Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Additionally, ""Terminator vs. Robocop"" in the fourth season was used to promote the upcoming release of the film Terminator Genisys and featured an appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. ERB's popularity has also led to collaboration with mainstream artists. Shukoff and Ahlquist also created a two-minute rap battle scene used in The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_rap,Cloud rap,Rap music history,"Cloud rap is a subgenre of hip hop music that has several sonic characteristics of trap music with a hazy, dreamlike and relaxed production style. Rapper Lil B and producer Clams Casino were early pioneers of the style. The term ""cloud rap"" is derived from its internet origins and ethereal style. Cloud rap originated in Atlanta, Houston, and Memphis during the late 2000's. The term ""cloud rap"" is popularly used in reference to lo-fi, hazy rap. Elements of cloud rap, like lo-fi and dreamy atmospheres, appear as early as 1996 with N.O.D.'s self-titled album, as well as in 2001, with Clouddead's self-titled album. Later in 2006 more building blocks, such as hazy and relaxed sounds, are on Viper's second album, Ready and... Willing. In a 2009 article, music writer Noz wrote that rapper Lil B showed him a CGI image of a castle in the clouds and said ""that's the kind of music I want to make"", crediting Lil B with the coining of the term. Producer Clams Casino has also been credited with pioneering the cloud rap sound as early as 2010 through collaborations with Lil B. The term was also used in the Space Age Hustle blog's compilation of songs, 3 Years Ahead: The Cloud Rap Tape. The compilation consists of songs that fall in the cloud rap genre.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_music,Drill music,Rap music history,"Drill music, also known as drill rap or simply drill, is a subgenre of hip-hop music that originated in Chicago in the early 2010s. It is sonically similar to the trap subgenre and lyrically similar to the gangsta rap subgenre. Drill lyricism is noted for its ominous, confrontational nature, often including references to gang rivalries and various incidents, sometimes murder, although the subgenre is thematically broader. Drill artists often address authentic, real-life conflicts, at times incorporating artistic expressions such as bravado, taunting or mockery. Early drill artists are typically noted for their associations with crime in Chicago, especially with the Black Disciples and Gangster Disciples. The genre garnered mainstream attention in 2012 following the success of pioneering Chicago rappers like Chief Keef, Lil Durk, Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, G Herbo, Lil Bibby, King Louie, FBG Duck and producer Young Chop. Other rappers, such as Lil JoJo, S. Dot, Edai, L'A Capone, RondoNumbaNine, Lil Mister, SD and producer Leek-E-Leek also contributed to the early drill scene. Additionally, DJ's including DJ Kenn Aon and DJ Hustlenomics were conducive to the subgenre's early growth. Female rappers such as Sasha Go Hard, Katie Got Bandz, and the group Pretty N Pink developed the distinctive feminine style of drill music. Chicago drill saw a resurgence in the mainstream during the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists such as King Von, Polo G, Calboy, FBG Duck and a revamped Lil Durk. By the 2020s, drill's popularity spread globally, with the BBC in 2021 describing drill as ""the sound of the global youth"". The UK drill scene emerged in the mid-2010s, leading to the prominence of artists such as 67, Harlem Spartans, CGM, and Skengdo x AM. UK drill subsequently influenced regional scenes in Europe and America, including Brooklyn drill, which gained mainstream popularity in the early 2020s with artists like Pop Smoke and Fivio Foreign. Drill scenes have been noted in such locales as Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, Ghana, Uganda, Denmark and France. The subgenre's controversial nature has stimulated discussion. Public debate about the implications drill rap has raged, while some authorities, elected officials, and commentators in the UK and America castigate the genre and its artists, claiming that drill rap catalyzes real world violence.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari,Rastafari,Rastafari movement,"Rastafari is an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It is classified as both a new religious movement and a social movement by scholars of religion. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas. Rastafari beliefs are based on an interpretation of the Bible. Central to the religion is a monotheistic belief in a single God, referred to as Jah, who partially resides within each individual. Rastas accord key importance to Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia between 1930 and 1974, who is regarded variously as the Second Coming of Jesus, Jah incarnate, or a human prophet. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or ""Babylon"". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the Promised Land, or ""Zion"". Rastas refer to their practices as ""livity"", which includes adhering to Ital dietary requirements, wearing their hair in dreadlocks, and following patriarchal gender roles. Communal meetings are known as ""groundations"", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the smoking of cannabis, the latter regarded as a sacrament with beneficial properties. Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised Afro-Jamaican communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant British colonial culture. It was influenced by both Ethiopianism and the Back-to-Africa movement promoted by black nationalist figures such as Marcus Garvey. The religion developed after several Protestant Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's countercultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. Early Rastafari often espoused black supremacy as a form of opposition to white supremacy, but this has gradually become less common since the 1970s. In the 1960s and 1970s, it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rastafari-inspired reggae musicians, most notably Bob Marley. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the mo",Rastafari | Abrahamic religions | Afro-Caribbean religion | Cannabis and religion | Cultural depictions of Haile Selassie | Monotheistic religions | New religious movements established in the 1930s | Religions that require vegetarianism,"1930, 1974",Definition | Beliefs | Jah and Jesus Christ | Haile Selassie | Afrocentrism and race | Exile in Babylon | Return to Zion | Salvation and paradise,,3193,2025-06-22 19:34:39
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement_in_the_United_States,Rastafari movement in the United States,Rastafari movement,"The Rastafari movement in the United States echoes the Rastafari religious movement, which began in Jamaica and Ethiopia during the 1930s. Marcus Garvey, born in Jamaica, was influenced by the Ethiopian king Haile Selassie. Jamaican Rastafaris began emigrating to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, and established communities throughout the country. The name Rastafari derives from Ras Tafari, the title (ras) and first name of Haile Selassie (Täfäri Mäkonnän) before his coronation. In Amharic, ras (""head"") is an Ethiopian title equivalent to prince or chief; the given name Täfäri (teferi) means ""one who is revered"". Rastafari originated in Jamaica and Ethiopia. Jah is a name of God, a shortened form of Yahweh. Most Rastafaris see Haile Selassie as Jah or Jah Rastafari, an incarnation of God. Rastafari includes the spiritual use of cannabis and the rejection of a society of materialism, oppression, and sensual pleasures it calls ""Babylon"". Rastas assert that Zion (Ethiopia) is a land promised to them by Jah. ""Babylon"" is considered to have been rebelling against ""Earth's Rightful Ruler"" (Jah) since the days of the biblical king Nimrod. The lion is a symbol of Rastafari because it appears on the flag used in Haile Selassie's Ethiopia. Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican activist, spoke about creating an African state for displaced Africans; this idea influenced many Black people. According to Garvey, Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was the only remaining African monarch with Biblical ancestry. Working-class Jamaicans viewed Garvey as a prophet and the reincarnation of John the Baptist; when Ras Täfäri of Ethiopia was crowned emperor in 1930, many proclaimed Haile Selassie as Jah (God). Although the movement has had cultural, social, and political effects on Ethiopia and Jamaica, little scholarly research has been done on its effects in the United States. A number of Rastafari see the country as the heart of evil in the world, but many Jamaican Rastafari made the United States their new home during the 1960s and 1970s. The Rastafari movement played a role in shaping local U.S. society and culture, seen in Garvey's accomplishments, the effects of Rastafari community-building, and riddim and reggae music.[citation needed]",Rastafari | Religion in the United States by religion | Jamaican-American history,1930,Background | Marcus Garvey | Universal Negro Improvement Association | Negro Factories Corporation | Black Star Line | Community-building | See also | References,,2246,2025-06-22 19:34:39

Such groups include the Bobo Ashanti, the Niyabinghi, the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and several smaller groups, including African Unity, Covenant Rastafari, Messianic Dreads, SeeGold Empire, and the Selassian Church. The term is taken from the Biblical verse in John 14:2, ""In my Father's house are many mansions."" Many individual Rastas are only loosely affiliated with these Mansions, or not at all, in keeping with the principle of freedom of conscience, a general distrust of institutionalism shared by many, and the teachings of Haile Selassie I as Emperor that ""faith is private"" and a direct relationship requiring no intermediary.[original research?] Beliefs differ between the mansions, with varying views on the Bible, dreadlocks, diet, and ganja. The Twelve Tribes of Israel is a Rastafari group founded in Kingston, Jamaica in 1968, and now functioning worldwide. Its founder, Vernon Carrington, was known as Prophet Gad, and taught his students to read the Bible 'a chapter a day'.

Nowadays it is particularly concerning their spiritual use of cannabis and discrimination related to spiritual hair styles mainly dreadlocks. There was a growing grassroots movement in Jamaica that combined ethiopianism, a belief that black people in the new world will be rescued by God as his chosen people, with faith healing and revival churches. Laws like the Obeah Act of 1898, which made it Illegal to use or pretend to use supernatural powers or knowledge, and the Medical Law of 1908, which created a council to regulate medical practice in Jamaica, were used to disrupt these movements and redirect medical and religious authority back to the state. One of the most prominent figures of this period was Alexander Bedward, a faith healer and self-proclaimed profit. He was eventually locked up in a asylum for his religious claims. The first Rastafari to appear in a court was Leonard Howell in Jamaica in 1934 who was charged with sedition for refusing to accept George V of the United Kingdom as his King, instead insisting that he was only loyal to Haile Selassie and the Ethiopian Empire. He was found guilty and sentenced to several years in prison. By the 1950s, Rastafari's message of pride and unity had unnerved the ruling class of Jamaica.

The name was supposedly taken from a legendary Rwandan, Ugandan, or Tanzanian woman whose name is said to mean ""she who possesses many things"". This woman's name later inspired the Nyabingi rebellion movement that began in Uganda. Some people think this name was later taken by some members of the Rastafari movement and was used to create a current frame of thought. This name, Niyabingi, was actually mainly attributed to the prisoners across the continent of Africa and later groups of people in Jamaica (mainly from Pinnacle, the Rastafarian camp of Leonard P.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae,Reggae,Reggae music Jamaica,"Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/ ⓘ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica during the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, ""Do the Reggay"", was the first popular song to use the word reggae, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. Reggae is rooted in traditional Jamaican Kumina, Pukkumina, Revival Zion, Nyabinghi, and burru drumming. Jamaican reggae music evolved out of the earlier genres mento, ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing), calypso, and also draws influence from traditional African folk rhythms. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower-paced than both ska and rocksteady. The concept of call and response can be found throughout reggae music. The genre of reggae music is led by the drum and bass. Some key players in this sound are Jackie Jackson from Toots and the Maytals, Carlton Barrett from Bob Marley and the Wailers, Lloyd Brevett from the Skatalites, Paul Douglas from Toots and the Maytals, Lloyd Knibb from the Skatalites, Winston Grennan, Sly Dunbar, and Anthony ""Benbow"" Creary from the Upsetters. The bass guitar often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and equalized so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The guitar in reggae usually plays on the offbeat of the rhythm. It is common for reggae to be sung in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican English, and Iyaric dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting",Reggae | Jamaican styles of music | Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity | 1960s in music,"1980, 1967, 1968",Etymology | History | Precursors | Emergence in Jamaica | International popularity | Reggae heritage | Musical characteristics | Drums and other percussion,"Stylistic origins: MentocalypsonyabinghiR&Bjazzskarocksteady | Cultural origins: Late 1960s Jamaica, particularly Kingston | Derivative forms: Dancehalldubnew waveraggajungledrum and bass",3956,2025-06-22 19:33:03

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Jamaica,Music of Jamaica,Reggae music Jamaica,"The music of Jamaica includes Jamaican folk music and many popular genres, such as mento, ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub music, dancehall, reggae fusion and related styles. Reggae is especially popular through the fame of Bob Marley. Jamaican music's influence on music styles in other countries includes the practice of toasting, which was brought to New York City and evolved into rapping. British genres such as Lovers rock, jungle music and grime are also influenced by Jamaican music. Mento is a style of Jamaican music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Lord Flea and Count Lasher are two of the more successful mento artists. Well-known mento songs include Day-O, Jamaica Farewell and Linstead Market. Mento is often confused with Calypso music, a musical form from Trinidad and Tobago. As in many Anglo-Caribbean islands, the calypso music of Trinidad and Tobago has become part of the culture of Jamaica. Jamaica's own local music mento is often confused with calypso music. Although the two share many similarities, they are separate and distinct musical forms. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently referred to as calypso, kalypso and mento calypso; mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques. As in calypso, mento uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues. Sexual innuendos are also common. The Trinidadian calypso and soca music are popular in Jamaica. Popular calypso/soca artists from Jamaica include Byron Lee, Fab 5, and Lovindeer. Harry Belafonte (born in the U.S., raised in Jamaica from age 5 to 13) introduced American audiences to calypso music (which had originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 20th century), and Belafonte was dubbed the ""King of Calypso"".",Music of Jamaica,,Mento | Calypso and Soca | Jazz | Ska | DJs and toasting | Rocksteady | Reggae | Dub,,1826,2025-06-22 19:33:04
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall,Dancehall,Reggae music Jamaica,"Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially, dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. This music genre wasn't officially named until the 1980s, when the two words Dance and Hall (referring to the common venue) were joined to form Dancehall, which was then promoted internationally for the first time. At that time digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or ""ragga"") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of Jamaican Patois rather than Jamaican standard English and a focus on the track instrumentals (or ""riddims""). Dancehall saw initial mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s; by the 1990s, it became increasingly popular in Jamaican diaspora communities. In the 2000s, dancehall experienced worldwide mainstream. By the 2010s, it began to heavily influence the work of established Western artists and producers, which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream. Dancehall is named after Jamaican dance halls in which popular Jamaican recordings were played by local sound systems. It both refers to the music and dance style. It faced criticism for negatively influencing Jamaican culture and portraying gangster lifestyles in a praiseworthy way.[citation needed] Dancehall music, also called ragga, is a style of Jamaican popular music that had its genesis in the political turbulence of the late 1970s and became Jamaica's dominant music in the 1980s and '90s. It was also originally called Bashment music when Jamaican dancehalls began to gain popularity. They began in the late 1970s among lower and working-class people from the inner city of Kingston, who were not able to participate in dances uptown. Social and political changes in late-1970s Jamaica, including the change from the socialist government of Michael Manley (People's National Party) to Edward Seaga (Jamaica Labour Party), were reflected in the shift away from the more internationally oriented roots reggae towards a style geared more towards local consumption and in tune with the music that Jamaicans had experienced when sound systems performed live.",Dancehall | 20th-century music genres | Caribbean music genres | Music of Jamaica | Reggae genres,,History | Lead | Early developments - Early 1970s | Origination from the DJ scene | 1980s–1990s (The Naming) | 2000s | Modern era: 2015—present | Musical characteristics,"Stylistic origins: Reggaedubtoastingelectronicskarocksteady | Cultural origins: Late 1970s Jamaica, especially Kingston | Derivative forms: Reggaetondembowafroswing",2315,2025-06-22 19:33:05
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music,Dub music,Reggae music Jamaica,"Dub is a musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne ""King Tubby"" Ruddock, Hopeton ""Scientist"" Brown, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Errol Thompson and others beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects. Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass, as well as a major influence on dubstep, with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material. The use of the word dub in a recording context originated in the late 1920s with the advent of ""talking pictures"" and referred to adding a soundtrack to a film; it is an informal abbreviation of the word double. Over the next 40 years or so the term found its way into audio recording in general, often in the context of making a copy of a recording on another tape or disc. It was in this sense that the term was first used in the Jamaican recording industry: new recordings were often initially copied onto one-off acetate discs, known colloquially as soft wax or dub and later as dubplates, f",Dub music | Reggae genres | Jamaican styles of music | Electronic music genres | Popular music | 1960s in music,1968,"Name | Characteristics | History | ""Versions"" and experiments with studio mixing (late 1960s) | Evolution of dub as a subgenre (1970s) | Dub history (since the early 1980s) | Musical impact | Influence of dub","Stylistic origins: Reggaeelectronicskarocksteady | Cultural origins: Late 1960s, Jamaica | Derivative forms: Ambientbig beatdancehalldembowdrum and bassdubstepgrimehip hophousejunglepost-discopost-punkpost-rocktechnotrip hop",3037,2025-06-22 19:33:06

Unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) charged with using excessive force in the arrest and beating of Rodney King. The incident had been videotaped by George Holliday, who was a bystander to the incident, and was heavily broadcast in various news and media outlets. The rioting took place in several areas in the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over six days following the verdict's announcement. Widespread looting, assault, and arson occurred during the riots, which local police forces had difficulty controlling. The situation in the Los Angeles area was resolved after the California National Guard, United States military, and several federal law enforcement agencies deployed more than 10,000 of their armed responders to assist in ending the violence and unrest. When the riots including multiple shootouts had ended, 63 people had been killed, 2,383 had been injured, more than 12,000 had been arrested, and estimates of property damage were over $1 billion, making it the most destructive period of local unrest in US history. Koreatown, situated just to the north of South Central LA, was disproportionately damaged because of racial tensions between communities. Much of the blame for the extensive nature of the violence was attributed to LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates, who had already announced his resignation by the time of the riots, for failure to de-escalate the situation and overall mismanagement.",1992 Los Angeles riots | Race riots in the United States | Racism in the United States | History of Los Angeles | Mass murder in 1992 | Arson in California | Presidency of George H.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King,Rodney King,Rodney King riots 1992,"Rodney Glen King (April 2, 1965 – June 17, 2012) was a black American victim of police brutality. On March 3, 1991, he was severely beaten by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) during his arrest after a high speed pursuit for driving while intoxicated on Interstate 210. An uninvolved resident, George Holliday, saw and filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage, which showed King on the ground being beaten, to a local news station KTLA. The incident was covered by news media around the world and caused a public uproar. At a press conference, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates announced that the four officers who were involved would be disciplined for use of excessive force and that three would face criminal charges. The LAPD initially charged King with ""felony evading"", but later dropped the charge. On his release, King spoke to reporters from his wheelchair, with his injuries evident: a broken right leg in a cast, his face badly cut and swollen, bruises on his body, and a burn area on his chest where he had been jolted with a stun gun. King described how he had knelt, spread his hands out, then slowly tried to move so as not to make any ""stupid moves"", before he was hit across the face by a billy club, and shocked with a stun gun. King also said he was scared for his life when the officers drew their guns on him. Four officers were eventually tried on charges of use of excessive force. Of them, three were acquitted; the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots started, sparked by outrage among racial minorities over the trial's verdict and related, long-standing social issues, overlaid with tensions between African Americans and Korean Americans. The rioting lasted six days and 63 people were killed during it, and 2,383 other people were injured; it only ended after the California Army National Guard, the Army, and the Marine Corps provided reinforcements in an attempt to reestablish control. King advocated a peaceful end to the conflict. The federal government prosecuted a separate civil rights case, obtaining grand jury indictments of the four officers for violations of King's civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended in April 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to serve prison terms. The other two were acquitted of the charges.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riot_Within,The Riot Within,Rodney King riots 1992,"The Riot Within: My Journey from Rebellion to Redemption is a 2012 autobiography of Rodney King (1965–2012). Known by a videotape as a victim of Los Angeles Police Department brutality, he became a civil rights icon. The book is co-authored by Lawrence J. Spagnola, an award-winning writer. King discusses his childhood growing up among loving parents but at times an abusive father, and their shared love for fishing. His father was alcoholic, and he also has had to deal with alcoholism in his adult life. King speaks highly of his teacher Robert E. Jones at John Muir High School, who was openly gay. He discusses his descent into addiction and alcoholism and his run-ins with the law, including when he was stopped and beaten by Los Angeles Police officers. This event was videotaped by a bystander, and carried on national news. There was outrage when the officers were acquitted of charges of excessive force. King reflects on his multicultural heritage. He said that he did not want the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the acquittal of the officers at trial. King reflects his reluctance as a civil rights icon, after a federal trial in which two of the officers were convicted. The city of LA made a settlement with him, paying damages. He felt as if he attracted opportunists and was used by some. He continued to battle addiction and other issues. The book finally wraps up with his obtaining sobriety and discussing lessons he has learned. The Riot Within received mostly positive reviews by both the independent and mainstream media.

She is best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in defiance of Jim Crow laws, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. She is also sometimes known as the ""mother of the civil rights movement"". Parks joined the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1943, serving as the organization's secretary. Despite various policies designed to disenfranchise Black citizens, Parks successfully registered to vote after three separate attempts between 1943 and 1945. She investigated and organized campaigns around cases of racial and sexual violence in her capacity as NAACP secretary, including those of Recy Taylor and Jeremiah Reeves, laying the groundwork for future civil rights campaigns. Prior to Parks's refusal to move, numerous Black Montgomerians had engaged in similar acts of resistance against segregated public transportation. After Parks's arrest in 1955, local activists decided to use her case as a test case against segregation, leading the Women's Political Council (WPC) to organize a one-day bus boycott on the day of her trial. The boycott was widespread, with many Black Montgomerians refusing to ride the buses that day. After Parks was found guilty of violating state law, it was extended indefinitely, with the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) organizing its own community transportation network to sustain it. During this time, Parks and other boycott leaders faced harassment, ostracization, and various legal obstacles. The boycott lasted for 381 days, finally concluding after segregation on Montgomery buses was deemed unconstitutional in the court case Browder v.

Angela Bassett portrays Rosa Parks, with Cicely Tyson in a supporting role as her mother. It was broadcast by CBS on February 24, 2002. It received awards from the NAACP and the Black Reel Awards. The film is an account of the life of Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks and her actions in the civil rights movement. After she refused to give up her seat for a White man on a racially segregated bus after a long day at work, she was arrested. Her example and treatment prompted a bus boycott as a major civil rights demonstration in Montgomery, Alabama; it lasted 381 days from 1955 to 1956. In the film, Parks's background is highlighted, and the issues in the segregated society of Alabama and the Deep South are indicated. As a child, Rosa was educated at a private school run by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), where she was encouraged to overcome the limits of segregation. In her late-adolescence, she married Raymond Parks, a barber and advocate of equal rights. She joins the local branch of the NAACP, although her husband believes that the organization has been ineffective in its battle against legalized racism. She worked as a seamstress in a department store. On December 1, 1955, after a tiring day at work, Rosa Parks took a seat in the designated ""colored"" section of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. When the ""White"" section at the front filled up, the driver, James Blake, ordered Parks to relinquish her seat, as was the practice. She refused, and was arrested and jailed. Civil rights activists organized a one-day bus boycott the day of her trial (she was fined). With its success, they founded the Montgomery Improvement Association, and began a citywide bus boycott, led by a new local minister, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The boycott lasted 381 days, made to work by African-American citizens, many of whom made sacrifices of time and energy to walk to work and other destinations. As they comprised the majority of bus passengers, the boycott greatly reduced the profits the bus company earned. Eventually, the a ruling by the United States Supreme Court, in a related case, declared bus segregation unconstitutional. The boycott was important for mobilizing people in the civil rights movement both in the Deep South and on a nationwide basis across the United States.",2002 television films | 2002 films | 2002 biographical drama films | African-American biographical dramas | Films set in the 1950s | Films set in 1955 | Films set in Alabama | Films shot in Alabama,"1956, 2002, 1955",Background and synopsis | Cast | Awards | See also | References | External links,Based on: Montgomery bus boycott | Written by: Paris Qualles | Screenplay by: Paris Qualles | Directed by: Julie Dash | Starring: Angela BassettPeter Francis JamesCicely Tyson | Music by: Joseph Conlon,2417,2025-06-22 19:38:21

His wife called him ""the first real activist I ever met.” Parks was born in 1903 in Wedowee, Alabama, the son of David Parks and Geri Culbertson. He did not receive a formal education as there was no nearby black school where he lived. He taught himself to read with the help of his mother and had an appreciation for poetry. Parks spent much of his childhood caring for ill family members and was orphaned as a teenager. Parks worked as a barber in Tuskegee, Montgomery, Maxwell Air Force Base, Hampton, Virginia, and Detroit, Michigan.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide,Rwandan genocide,Rwanda genocide 1994,"The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, occurred from 7 April to 19 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War. Over a span of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were systematically killed by Hutu militias. While the Rwandan Constitution states that over 1 million people were killed, most scholarly estimates suggest between 500,000 and 662,000 Tutsi died, mostly men. The genocide was marked by extreme violence, with victims often murdered by neighbors, and widespread sexual violence, with between 250,000 and 500,000 women raped. The genocide was rooted in long-standing ethnic tensions, exacerbated by the Rwandan Civil War, which began in 1990 when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a predominantly Tutsi rebel group, invaded Rwanda from Uganda. The war reached a tentative peace with the Arusha Accords in 1993. However, the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994 ignited the genocide, as Hutu extremists used the power vacuum to target Tutsi and moderate Hutu leaders. Despite the scale of the atrocities, the international community failed to intervene to stop the killings. The RPF resumed military operations in response to the genocide, eventually defeating the government forces and ending the genocide by capturing all government-controlled territory. This led to the flight of the génocidaires and many Hutu refugees into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), contributing to regional instability and triggering the First Congo War in 1996. The legacy of the genocide remains significant in Rwanda. The country has instituted public holidays to commemorate the event and passed laws criminalizing ""genocide ideology"" and ""divisionism"".",Rwandan genocide | 1994 in Rwanda | 1994 murders in Africa | 20th-century mass murder in Africa | Ethnic cleansing in Africa | Genocides in Africa | Mass murder in 1994 | Massacres in Rwanda,"1990, 1993, 1996, 1994",Background | Revolution and Hutu–Tutsi relations after independence | Rwandan Civil War | Hutu Power movement | Prelude | Timeline | Radio station RTLM | Assassination of Habyarimana,"Location: Rwanda | Date: 7 April – 19 July 1994 | Target: Tutsi, moderate Hutu, Twa | Attack type: Genocide, mass murder, genocidal rape, ethnic cleansing | Deaths: Estimated:

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_and_the_Rwandan_genocide,France and the Rwandan genocide,Rwanda genocide 1994,"The role of France in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi has been a source of controversy and debate both within and beyond France and Rwanda. France actively supported the Hutu-led government of Juvénal Habyarimana against the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, which since 1990 had been engaged in a conflict intended to restore the rights of Rwandan Tutsis both within Rwanda and exiled in neighboring countries following over four decades of anti-Tutsi violence. France provided arms and military training to Habyarimana's militias, the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, which were among the government's primary means of operationalizing the genocide following the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6, 1994. Near the end of the 100-day genocide, on June 23, French troops were deployed to establish the Turquoise Zone, largely preventing further waves of genocide within the purported safe zone. However, the zone also enabled many Hutu perpetrators of the genocide to safely escape into Zaire out of reach from the advancing and victorious RPF soldiers. The facts related to the French role in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi have formed the focus of ongoing debate, and diplomatic relations between France and Rwanda have frequently been strained since 1994. As a result of these actions and subsequent tensions between the two governments, after a progressive rift with the Kagame-led regime that has ruled Rwanda since 1994 (described in greater detail below), Rwanda repeatedly broke diplomatic relations with France; the Rwandan government shut down all French institutions in Rwanda, including schools and cultural organisations, with only some being subsequently reopened; the language of instruction in Rwandan schools ""has even been switched from French to English""; and Rwanda successfully applied to join the British-led Commonwealth, thus becoming one of only two members that were not former British colonies. In the analysis of investigative journalist Linda Melvern, documents released from the Paris archive of former president François Mitterrand show how the RPF invasion in October 1990 was considered as clear aggression by an Anglophone neighbour on a Francophone country. The documents are said to argue that the RPF was a part of an ""Anglophone plot"", involving the President of Uganda, to create an English-speaking ""Tutsi-land"" and increase Anglophone influence at the expense of French influence.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide_denial,Rwandan genocide denial,Rwanda genocide 1994,"Rwandan genocide denial is the pseudohistorical assertion that the Rwandan genocide did not occur, specifically rejection of the scholarly consensus that Rwandan Tutsis were the victims of genocide between 7 April and 19 July 1994. The perpetrators, a small minority of other Hutu, and some fringe Western writers dispute that reality. Aspects of the genocide, such as the death toll, prior planning of the genocide, responsibility for the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana that triggered the genocide, war crimes (considered a second genocide by some) by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and whether the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda should have tried RPF leaders continues to be debated by scholars. The Tutsi death toll in the genocide as well as the number of Hutu perpetrators (to the point of collective guilt) is inflated by the RPF government compared to estimates by scholars. People with views that differ from the government position may be accused of genocide denial, even if they accept that Tutsi were the victims of genocide. Denial of the Rwandan genocide is a crime in Rwanda, with laws against ""genocide ideology"" and ""divisionism"" used to target those who disagree with the government's official version of history and other critics of the government. Such laws have been accused of infringement on freedom of speech. A high-ranking Tutsi and a UN official have claimed that no genocide of the Tutsi took place at all: Antoine Nyetera, who claims Tutsi royal origins, and the former UN Representative in Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, who declared that ""to claim that a genocide occurred is closer to the politics of surrealism than to the truth"". During the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, US officials under the Clinton administration were instructed not to refer to it as genocide, but instead say that ""acts of genocide may have occurred."" As early as April 1994, the government had internally referred it as genocide, but they did not publicly refer to it as such until June. On a visit to Kigali, in 1998, Clinton apologized for not referring to it as genocide, and for not sending aid to Rwanda.",Rwandan genocide | Genocide denial | Pseudohistory | Aftermath of the Rwandan genocide | Incitement to genocide in Rwanda,"1994, 1998","Denial by officials | United States | Peter Erlinder | Fiona Fox | Edward S.

In late 1994, the military was rebuilt and reorganized as the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF). The RDF is organized into three service branches: Rwandan Land Force, Rwandan Air Force and Rwandan Reserve Force. After the RPF conquered the country in July 1994 in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, the RPF decided to reform solely as Rwanda's ruling political party and separate from its military wing, where the latter would serve as the country's official military. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of the national budget, largely due to continuing security problems along Rwanda's frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. The RDF has been engaged in a low-level insurgency from Rwandan rebels based in eastern Congo, primarily the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), since the late 1990s.

The Centre is a permanent memorial to those who fell victim to the genocide and serves as a place where the bereaved could bury their family and friends. The Centre is managed and run by the Aegis Trust on behalf of the National Commission for the Fight Against Genocide. The memorial and the memorial centre are in Gisozi, Rwanda, just outside of central Kigali. In April 1994, reports of systematic mass murder within Rwanda began to filter out of Rwanda and circulate throughout the world. Little was done to stop the genocide. To outsiders, the genocide was represented as tribal-based ethnic violence, with the Tutsis the victims and the Hutus as the perpetrators. Precisely how many people were actually murdered may never be known; estimates vary between 500,000 and over a million. The number of people killed is widely accepted as being somewhere close to 800,000. In 2000, the Kigali City Council began to construct a building, which would eventually become the Memorial Centre. Aegis was invited to turn the genocide memorial center into a reality. The Aegis Trust then began to collect data from across the world to create the three graphical exhibits.

Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son in 1828, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. She gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city and go into the countryside ""testifying to the hope that was in her."" Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title ""Ain't I a Woman?"", a variation of the original speech that was published in 1863 as being spoken in a stereotypical Black dialect, then more commonly spoken in the South. Sojourner Truth, however, grew up speaking Dutch as her first language. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for formerly enslaved people (summarized as the promise of ""forty acres and a mule""). She continued to fight on behalf of women and African Americans until her death. As her biographer Nell Irvin Painter wrote, ""At a time when most Americans thought of slaves as male and women as white, Truth embodied a fact that still bears repeating: Among the blacks are women; among the women, there are blacks."" A memorial bust of Truth was unveiled in 2009 in Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. She is the first African American woman to have a statue in the Capitol building.

The migrants competed for space and jobs against the city's residents as well as against European immigrants and their descendants. The riot escalated after a false rumor spread that a mob of whites had thrown a black mother and her baby into the Detroit River. Blacks looted and destroyed white property as retaliation.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth_Project,Sojourner Truth Project,Sojourner Truth,"As a strikingly controversial project in 1941, Sojourner Truth Project set precedents for Detroit housing project policy through the next decade. Created by the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC) and United States Housing Authority (USHA), the proposed 200 units would alleviate housing shortages caused by the wartime climate of World War II. However, the project was met with extreme backlash from white residents and middle-class black homeowners in Conant Gardens. Violence erupted in 1942 when black families moved into the project housing. More than a thousand black supporters and white opponents crowded streets culminating in violent displays later characterized as the Sojourner Truth riot. In 1941, during World War II, the DHC and USHA announced the Sojourner Truth project located in northeast Detroit at the heart of Seven Mile-Fenelon neighborhood. The location was purposely chosen because of its proximity to existing concentrations of black communities in an attempt to circumvent controversy. The 200 proposed units acted to alleviate wartime housing shortages. The original Sojourner Truth Project, constructed in 1942, contained 46 buildings. Of those, 26 were demolished in 1981, leaving only 20 remaining. In 1986 and 1987, 29 new buildings were constructed. The 20 original structures have been listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. These buildings are masonry structures, arranged in a grid pattern around the central section of the project. The historic buildings are long, two-story red brick rowhouses with side gabled roofs. A beige-colored brick string course runs around the building, just beneath the second-floor window sills. The side gable peaks of some buildings are clad in vinyl siding. Each building contains six individual units, side by side. The windows are a combination of slider and double hung units, Each building contains six entrances clustered in groups of two, with each cluster covered by a projecting awning. The entry doors are wood, with a porch light, address number, and cast iron mailbox nearby. To the rear, the buildings have enclosed mechanical additions clad in vinyl siding. White residents, outraged by public housing projects for impoverished Blacks, adamantly opposed the Sojourner Truth project. The Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association, formed by white residents between June 1941 and February 1942, viciously opposed the project's fruition.

Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851, and did not originally have a title. The speech was briefly reported in two newspapers at the time, and a transcript was published in the Anti-Slavery Bugle on June 21, 1851. In 1863, during the American Civil War, Frances Dana Barker Gage published a significantly different version with speech more typical of southern African Americans. This version became known as ""Ain't I a Woman?"", because of its oft-repeated question (which does not appear in the earlier version). This later, better known and more widely available version was the one commonly referenced in popular culture and, until historian Nell Irvin Painter's 1996 biography of Truth, by historians as well. In her speech, Truth questions the treatment of white women compared to black women. Seemingly pointing out a man in the room, Truth says, ""That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere."" In the Gage version, she exclaims that no one ever does any of these things for her, repeating the question, ""And ain't I a woman?"" several times. She says that she has worked and birthed many children, making her as much a woman as anyone else. Despite giving birth to children just like white women did, black women were not treated with the same respect as white women. Black women were women, but because their race was seen as inferior, being a woman did not mean much if they were not white. There is no official published version of her speech; many rewritings of it were published anywhere from one month to 12 years after it was spoken.",Pre-emancipation African-American history | 1850s speeches | 1851 works | Women's rights | History of women in the United States | 1851 in Ohio | Sojourner Truth | May 1851,"1863, 1996, 1797, 1827, 1883, 1851",Background | Different versions | The speech | 1851 version by Robinson | 1863 version by Gage | Legacy | See also | References,,1931,2025-06-22 19:38:37

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul,Neo soul,Soul music origins,"Neo soul (sometimes called progressive soul) is a genre of popular music. As a term, it was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from funk, jazz fusion, and hip hop, and to pop, rock, and electronic music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence. Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, by Black-Americans in the United States, as a soul revival movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists, including D'Angelo, Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill. Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&B of the time, although many of them were ambivalent about the term. Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&B, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists. Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s, although newer artists emerged through more independent means of marketing their music. In his book The Essential Neo Soul (2010), music journalist and culture critic Chris Campbell writes that, while the genre has been ""woefully misunderstood and its artists mis-marketed"", there is ""a historical and social relevance that validates its designation as the current face of alternative progressive soul music (in both underground and overground circles), complete with a distinct origin and developmental evolution"". According to Mark Anthony Neal, ""neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop."" By definition, neo-soul is a paradox. Neo means new. Soul is timeless. All the neo-soul artists, in various ways, perform balancing acts, exploring classic soul idioms while injecting a living, breathing presence into time-tested formulas. They humanize R&B, which has often been reduced to a factory-perfected product.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music,Soul music,Soul music origins,"See also: Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in African-American communities throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body movements, are an important hallmark of soul. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead and backing vocalists, an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music is known for reflecting African-American identity and stressing the importance of African-American culture. Soul has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues, and primarily combines elements of gospel, R&B and jazz. The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in its proliferation during the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre neo soul, which incorporated modern production elements and hip hop influences. Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Many prominent soul artists, including Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and various acts under the Motown label, such as The Supremes and The Temptations, were highly influential in the genre's development and all gained widespread popularity during this time. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists moved to funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more socially conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had begun to absorb influences from psychedelic rock and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to the creation of psychedelic soul and progressive soul. Prominent soul artists of this era include Marvin Gaye, Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, Al Green, and Bill Withers.

The music originated from a combination of styles, including blues (both 12 bar and jump), country, early R&B, and a strong gospel influence that emanated from the sounds of Southern black churches. Bass guitar, drums, horn section, organ, and gospel roots vocal are important to soul groove. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of funk music. The terms ""deep soul"", ""country soul"", ""downhome soul"" and ""hard soul"" have been used synonymously with ""Southern soul"".p. 18 See also: Some soul musicians were from southern states: these included Georgia natives Otis Redding and James Brown, Rufus Thomas and Bobby ""Blue"" Bland (from Tennessee), Eddie Floyd (from Alabama), Johnnie Taylor, Al Green (from Arkansas).

Lewis signed soul and blues artists such as Toissaint McCall, Bobby Rush, John Lee Hooker, Charles Brown, Buster Benton, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Ted Taylor and Little Johnny Taylor. In 1966, the Shreveport-based Murco Records released ""Losin' Boy"" by Eddy Giles, which held a place on Cashbox magazine's Hot 100 for five weeks. Murco Records had soul chart success with its other artist included Reuben Bell.",20th-century music genres | Culture of the Southern United States | Soul music genres | Country music genres,"1966, 1963",History | 1960s–1980s | 1990s–present | See also | References | External links,"Stylistic origins: Soulbluescountryrhythm and bluesgospel | Cultural origins: Late 1950s, Southern United States | Derivative forms: Memphis soul",1477,2025-06-22 19:33:20
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music,History of music,Soul music origins,"Although definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world, every known culture partakes in it, and it is thus considered a cultural universal. The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with language. Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs. The music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to c. 40,000 BP of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000 BP). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation. Upon the development of writing, the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing Classic of Poetry. The eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the Tang dynasty's music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, the Japanese gagaku and Korean court music each influenced each other. Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely influenced Indian classical music, and the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis for subsequent Chinese music. Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 7th century, Islamic music dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the presen",Music history | History by topic,,Origins | Prehistory | Antiquity | China | Greece | India | Persia and Mesopotamia | Other Arab and African cultures,,3800,2025-06-22 19:33:21
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_soul,Psychedelic soul,Soul music origins,"Psychedelic soul (originally called black rock or conflated with psychedelic funk) is a form of soul music which emerged in the United States in the late 1960s. The style saw African-American soul musicians embrace elements of psychedelic rock, including its production techniques, instrumentation, effects units such as wah-wah and phasing, and drug influences. It came to prominence in the late 1960s and continued into the 1970s, playing a major role in the development of funk and disco. Pioneering acts working in the genre included Sly and the Family Stone, Isaac Hayes, the Temptations, the Chambers Brothers, and Parliament-Funkadelic. Following the lead of Jimi Hendrix as he moved from soul to psychedelic rock, the psychedelic subculture of the 1960s began to have a widespread impact on African-American musicians, particularly the stars of the Motown label. Influenced by the civil rights movement, this style had a darker and more political edge than much contemporary psychedelic rock. The Temptations and their producer Norman Whitfield moved from a relatively light vocal group into more hard-edged and topical material like ""Cloud Nine"" (1968), ""Runaway Child, Running Wild"" (1969), and ""Psychedelic Shack"" (1969). Sly and the Family Stone also helped pioneer the sound with songs like ""Dance to the Music"" (1968), ""Everyday People"" (1968) and ""I Want to Take You Higher"" (1969), which combined psychedelic rock with funk and emphasized distorted electric guitar and strong basslines. Other Motown acts soon followed into psychedelic territory, including the Supremes with ""Reflections"" (1967), ""Love Child"" (1968), and ""Stoned Love"" (1970). Psychedelic influences could also be heard in the early 1970s work of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye's 1971 album What's Going On. Acts that broke through with psychedelic soul included the Chambers Brothers with ""Time Has Come Today"" (1966, but charting in 1968), Arthur Brown with ""Fire"" (1968), the 5th Dimension with a cover of Laura Nyro's ""Stoned Soul Picnic"" (1968), Edwin Starr with ""War"" (1970), and the Undisputed Truth with ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" (1971). George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took influence from Detroit rock groups including MC5 and the Stooges, using extended distorted guitar solos and psychedelic sound effects coupled with surreal imagery and stage antics forming part of an Afrofuturist overarching mythology, leading to three US top ten singles,",Psychedelic soul | Psychedelic music | Soul music genres | 20th-century music genres,"1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1969",History | Origins | Development | Decline and influence | Modern artists | See also | References,"Other names: Black rockpsychedelic funk | Stylistic origins: Soulpsychedelic rockrhythm and blues | Cultural origins: Mid to late 1960s, United States | Derivative forms: Funk rockcinematic soulneo-psychedeliadisco",2700,2025-06-22 19:33:22
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising,Soweto uprising,Soweto uprising 1976,"The Soweto uprising, also known as the Soweto riots, was a series of demonstrations and protests led by black school children in South Africa during apartheid that began on the morning of 16 June 1976. Students from various schools began to protest in the streets of the Soweto township in response to the introduction of Afrikaans, considered by many blacks as the ""language of the oppressor"", as the medium of instruction in black schools. It is estimated that 20,000 students took part in the protests. They were met with fierce police brutality, and many were shot and killed. The number of pupils killed in the uprising is usually estimated as 176, but some sources estimate as many as 700 fatalities. The riots were a key moment in the fight against apartheid as it sparked renewed opposition against apartheid in South Africa both domestically and internationally. In remembrance of these events, 16 June is a public holiday in South Africa, named Youth Day. Internationally, 16 June is known as The Day of the African Child (DAC). Black South African high school students in Soweto protested against the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974, which forced all black schools to use Afrikaans and English in equal terms as languages of instruction. The association of Afrikaans with apartheid prompted black South Africans to prefer English. Even the Bantustan regimes chose English and an indigenous African language as official languages. In addition, English was gaining prominence as the language most often used in commerce and industry. The 1974 decree was intended to force the reverse of the decline of Afrikaans among black Africans. The Afrikaner-dominated government used the clause of the 1909 Union of South Africa Act that recognised only English and Dutch, the latter being replaced by Afrikaans in 1925, as official languages as its pretext. All schools had to provide instruction in both Afrikaans and English as languages, but white South African students learned other subjects in their home language. The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors and Principals of Schools that from 1 January 1975, Afrikaans had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the Afrikaans Medium Decree. English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science).

The inaugural Soweto Pride was held in 2004 and it happens annually, on the last Saturday of September. The aim of Soweto Pride is to create a space for primarily black lesbian, queer, and trans women, as well as non-binary people, to participate in pride events, engage with the Soweto community, and unite their voices on issues that affect them. South Africa’s apartheid history and the remnants of the legacy of racism still manifest in the mainstream pride parades in South Africa’s major cities. South Africa is considered a haven for LGBTQIA+ people and a leader in ensuring their rights are protected and institutionalized through post-apartheid 1996 Constitution which in its bill of rights explicitly provides for the protection of people on the basis of their sexual orientation. This made South Africa the first country in the world to protect individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation constitutionally. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2006. However, black lesbian, queer, trans and women in South Africa continue to face heightened violence, discrimination, marginalization and exclusion.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Montsitsi,Dan Montsitsi,Soweto uprising 1976,"Sediane Danny ""Sechaba"" Montsitsi (24 May 1952 – 13 June 2021) was a South African politician and former anti-apartheid activist. One of the leaders of the 1976 Soweto uprising, he later represented the African National Congress in Parliament from 1994 to 2014. Born in Alexandra, Montsitsi entered student politics during apartheid through the South African Students Movement in Soweto. He was the president of the Soweto Students' Representative Council from January 1977 until June 1977, when he was arrested and detained for his role in the uprising and subsequent unrest. In what became known as the Soweto 11 trial, Montsitsi and his deputy, Murphy Morobe, were convicted with nine others on sedition charges. After four years' imprisonment on Robben Island from 1979 to 1983, he became a youth leader in the United Democratic Front of the Transvaal. He served in the post-apartheid National Assembly from 1994 to 2009 and then in the National Council of Provinces from 2009 to 2014. Montsitsi was born on 24 May 1952 in Alexandra, a township outside Johannesburg in the former Transvaal. He attended Sekano-Ntoane Secondary School in Senaoane, Soweto, where he became involved in anti-apartheid student politics, joining the Black Consciousness-aligned South African Students Movement in 1974. On 16 June 1976, students in Soweto held a march against Bantu Education and the apartheid government's plan to institute Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in black schools. Montsitsi was one of the leaders of the Senaoane contingent of the march. After the police massacred protesting students, the protests continued, in what became known as the Soweto uprising. The programme in Soweto was largely coordinated by an action committee called the Soweto Students' Representative Council (SSRC), and Montsitsi became its third president, after his two predecessors – Tsietsi Mashinini and then Khotso Seathlolo – fled in succession into exile. He took over the presidency from Seathlolo in January 1977 and held the office until his arrest five months later.","1952 births | 2021 deaths | African National Congress politicians | Members of the National Council of Provinces | Members of the National Assembly of South Africa 1994–1999 | Members of the National Assembly of South Africa 1999–2004 | Members of the National Assembly of South Africa 2004–2009 | People from Alexandra, Gauteng","1976, 1994, 1977, 1983, 2014, 1979, 2021, 1952",Early life and activism | Soweto uprising: 1976–1977 | Soweto 11 trial and detention: 1977–1983 | United Democratic Front: 1983–1991 | Parliament: 1994–2014 | Retirement and death | References | External links,,2061,2025-06-22 19:41:12
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_Blues,Soweto Blues,Soweto uprising 1976,"""Soweto Blues"" is a protest song written by Hugh Masekela and performed by Miriam Makeba. The song is about the Soweto uprising that occurred in 1976, following the decision by the apartheid government of South Africa to make Afrikaans a medium of instruction at school. The uprising was forcefully put down by the police, leading to the death of between 176 and 700 people. The song was released in 1977 as part of Masekela's album You Told Your Mama Not to Worry. The song became a staple at Makeba's live concerts, and is considered a notable example of music in the movement against apartheid. In 1976, the apartheid government of South Africa decided to implement the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students began a series of protests on the morning of 16 June that came to be known as the Soweto Uprising. Students from numerous Sowetan schools began to protest in the streets of Soweto in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in local schools. An estimated 15,000–20,000 students took part in the protests. The police were caught unawares by the protests. After initially asking the students to disperse, the police opened fire on the protesting children in order to quell the protest. The number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700, while several hundred more were injured. The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement. The lyrics of ""Soweto Blues"" refer to the children's protests and the resulting massacre in the 1976 Soweto uprising. A review in the magazine Musician said that the song had ""searingly righteous lyrics"" that ""cut to the bone."" ""Soweto Blues"" was also one of many melancholic songs by Masekela that expressed his commitment to the anti-apartheid struggle, along with ""Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela),"" ""Been Gone Far Too Long,"" ""Mama,"" and ""The Coal Train."" Musically, the song has a background of Mbaqanga guitar, bass, and multi-grooved percussion. Makeba uses this as a platform for vocals that are half-sung and half-spoken, similar to blues music. The song was released in 1977 as part of Masekela's album You Told Your Mama Not to Worry. It was also included in Makeba's 1989 album Welela. The song became a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years after its release.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko,Steve Biko,Steve Biko South Africa,"Bantu Stephen Biko OMSG (18 December 1946 – 12 September 1977) was a South African anti-apartheid activist. Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the Black Consciousness Movement during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym Frank Talk. Raised in a poor Xhosa family, Biko grew up in Ginsberg township in the Eastern Cape. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the University of Natal, where he joined the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the apartheid system of racial segregation and white-minority rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white liberals, rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that well-intentioned white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a paternalistic manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the South African Students' Organisation (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to ""blacks"", a term that Biko used in reference not just to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white hatred and had white friends. The white-minority National Party government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism. Influenced by the Martinican philosopher Frantz Fanon and the African-American Black Power movement, Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward universal suffrage and a socialist economy. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan ""black is beautiful"". In 1972, he was involved in founding the Black People's Convention (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a banning order in 1973, severely restrictin",1946 births | 1977 deaths | 1977 in South Africa | 20th-century Christians | 20th-century South African male writers | 20th-century South African politicians | South African anti-apartheid activists | Assassinated South African activists,"1972, 1973, 1987, 1977, 1978, 1966, 1968, 1946",Biography | Early life: 1946–1966 | Early student activism: 1966–1968 | Founding the South African Students' Organisation: 1968–1972 | Black Consciousness activities and Biko's banning: 1971–1977 | Death: 1977 | Ideology | Black Consciousness and empowerment,"Born: Bantu Stephen Biko(1946-12-18)18 December 1946Tarkastad, Eastern Cape, South Africa | Died: 12 September 1977(1977-09-12) (aged 30)Pretoria, South Africa | Cause of death: Extensive brain injuries sustained from beatings by South African security officers | Resting place: Steve Biko Garden of Remembrance, Qonce, Eastern Cape | Other names: Frank Talk | Occupation: Anti-apartheid activist",3502,2025-06-22 19:40:01

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biko_(song),Biko (song),Steve Biko South Africa,"""Biko"" is an anti-apartheid protest song by the English rock musician Peter Gabriel. It was released by Charisma Records as a single from Gabriel's eponymous third studio album in 1980. The song is a musical eulogy, inspired by the death of the black South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko in police custody on 12 September 1977. Gabriel wrote the song after hearing of Biko's death on the news. Influenced by Gabriel's growing interest in African musical styles, the song carried a sparse two-tone beat played on Brazilian drum and vocal percussion, in addition to a distorted guitar, and a synthesised bagpipe sound. The lyrics, which included phrases in Xhosa, describe Biko's death and the violence under the apartheid government. The song is book-ended with recordings of songs sung at Biko's funeral: the album version begins with ""Ngomhla sibuyayo"" and ends with ""Senzeni Na?"", while the single versions end with ""Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika"". ""Biko"" reached No. 38 on the British charts, and was positively received, with critics praising the instrumentation, the lyrics, and Gabriel's vocals. A 2013 commentary called it a ""hauntingly powerful"" song, while review website AllMusic described it as a ""stunning achievement for its time"". It was banned in South Africa, where the government saw it as a threat to security. ""Biko"" was a personal landmark for Gabriel, becoming one of his most popular songs and sparking his involvement in human rights activism. It also had a huge political impact, and along with other contemporary music critical of apartheid, is credited with making resistance to apartheid part of western popular culture. It inspired musical projects such as Sun City, and has been called ""arguably the most significant non-South African anti-apartheid protest song"". Bantu Stephen Biko was an anti-apartheid activist who was a founding member of the South African Students' Organisation in 1968 and the Black People's Convention in 1972. Through these groups, and through other activities, he promoted the ideas of the Black Consciousness movement, and became a prominent member of the resistance to apartheid in the 1970s. The government of South Africa placed a banning order on him in 1973, preventing him from leaving his hometown, meeting with more than one person, publishing his writing, and speaking in public.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder,Stevie Wonder,Stevie Wonder,"Stevland Hardaway Morris (/ˈstiːvˌlənd/; né Judkins; born May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American and Ghanaian singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Wonder is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include R&B, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of contemporary R&B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name Little Stevie Wonder. Wonder's single ""Fingertips"" was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1963, when he was 13, making him the youngest solo artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His ""classic period"" began in 1972 with the releases of Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter featuring ""Superstition"", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness' First Finale (1974) and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his ""commercial period"" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes. Wonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a male solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film The Woman in Red). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his political activism, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the United States.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_in_the_Key_of_Life,Songs in the Key of Life,Stevie Wonder,"Songs in the Key of Life is the eighteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter and musician Stevie Wonder. A double album, it was released on September 28, 1976, by Tamla Records, a division of Motown. It was recorded primarily at Crystal Sound studio in Hollywood, with some sessions recorded at the Record Plant in Hollywood, the Record Plant in Sausalito, and The Hit Factory in New York City; final mixing was conducted at Crystal Sound. The album has been regarded by music journalists as the culmination of Wonder's ""classic period"" of recording. By 1974, Wonder was one of the most successful figures in popular music; his previous albums Music of My Mind (1972), Talking Book (1972), Innervisions (1973), and Fulfillingness' First Finale (1974) were all back-to-back critical successes. However, by March 1975, Wonder seriously considered quitting the music industry and emigrating to Ghana to aid children with disabilities. When plans for a farewell concert had already begun, Wonder changed his mind and signed a new contract with Motown on August 5, 1975. This outlined a seven-year, seven-album deal, with full artistic control. This deal included $13 million upfront, a potential bonus of up to $20 million, 20% of the royalties, and ownership of the publishing rights. At the time, it was the biggest recording deal in history. Songs in the Key of Life was released as a double LP with a four-song bonus EP. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming only the third album to achieve that feat, and the first by an American artist. Both the lead single ""I Wish"" and follow-up single ""Sir Duke"" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album spent thirteen consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming the album with the most weeks at number one during the year, and was the second-best-selling album of 1977 in the US. In 2005, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating sales of 5 million units for a double album. The album won Album of the Year at the 19th Grammy Awards and is the best-selling and most critically acclaimed album of Wonder's career. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums in history, and many musicians have remarked on its influence on their own work. It was voted number 89 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums and ranked number 4 on Rolling Stone's 2020 list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"". In 2002, the album was inducted ",1976 albums | Albums produced by Stevie Wonder | Albums recorded at Record Plant (Los Angeles) | Avant-pop albums | Grammy Award for Album of the Year | Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance | Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients | Progressive soul albums,"1976, 1972, 1975, 1973, 1977, 2005, 1974",Background | Recording | Critical reception | Commercial performance | Legacy and influence | Track listing | Original release | A Something's Extra EP,"Released: September 28, 1976 (1976-09-28) | Recorded: 1974–1976 | Studio: Crystal Sound, Hollywood

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition_(song),Superstition (song),Stevie Wonder,"""Superstition"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder. It was released on October 24, 1972, as the lead single from his fifteenth studio album, Talking Book (1972), by Tamla. The lyrics describe popular superstitions and their negative effects. ""Superstition"" reached number one in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in January 1973 and on the soul singles chart. It was Wonder's first number-one single since ""Fingertips, Pt. 2"" in 1963. It peaked at number eleven in the UK Singles Chart in February 1973. In November 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the song number 74 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was re-ranked number 73 on its 2010 list, and number 12 on its 2021 list. At the 16th Grammy Awards, the song earned Wonder two Grammys: ""Best Rhythm & Blues Song"" and ""Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male"". In 1998, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In the early 1970s, Wonder was playing most of the instruments on his songs by himself. But he preferred to let other guitarists play on his records, and after he learned that Jeff Beck was an admirer of his, an agreement was quickly made for Beck to become involved in the sessions that became the Talking Book album, in return for Wonder writing him a song. Between the album sessions, Beck came up with the opening drum beat. Wonder told Beck to keep playing while he improvised over the top of it. He improvised most of the song, including the riff, on the spot. Beck and Wonder created a rough demo for the song that day.",Songs about luck | 1972 singles | 1972 songs | 1973 singles | American funk songs | Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles | Cashbox number-one singles | Funk rock songs,"2010, 1963, 1972, 1973, 1998, 2021, 2004",Writing and recording | Reception | Personnel | Chart performance | Weekly charts | Year-end charts | Certifications | Other recorded versions,"B-side: ""You've Got It Bad Girl"" | Released: October 24, 1972 | Recorded: 1972 | Studio: Electric Lady, New York City",1518,2025-06-22 19:37:17
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_(Stevie_Wonder_song),Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder song),Stevie Wonder,"""Happy Birthday"" is a song written, produced and performed by Stevie Wonder for the Motown label. Wonder, a social activist, was one of the main figures in the campaign to have the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. become a national holiday, and created this single to promulgate the cause. The song has since become a standard for use during birthdays in general, particularly among African Americans. ""Happy Birthday"" was released as the fourth single of Wonder's Hotter than July (1980) album in June 1981. It was one of his most popular entries in the UK Singles Chart. It was not released in the United States, but is still regarded as one of his signature songs. The song, one of many of Wonder's songs to feature the use of a keyboard synthesizer, features Wonder lamenting the fact that anyone would oppose the idea of a Dr. King holiday, where ""peace is celebrated throughout the world"" and singing to King in the chorus, ""Happy birthday to you"". The holiday, he proposes, would facilitate the realization of Dr. King's dreams of integration and ""love and unity for all of God's children"". Wonder used the song to popularize the campaign, and continued his fight for the holiday, holding the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. United States President Ronald Reagan approved the creation of the holiday, signing it into existence on November 2, 1983. The first official Martin Luther King Jr. Day, held the third Monday in January of each year, was held on January 20, 1986, and was commemorated with a large-scale concert, where Wonder was the headlining performer. ""Happy Birthday"" was released as a single in several countries. In the UK, the song became one of Wonder's biggest hits, reaching number two in the charts in 1981.",1980 songs | 1981 singles | Motown singles | Number-one singles in Israel | Protest songs | Song recordings produced by Stevie Wonder | Songs about birthdays | Songs about Martin Luther King Jr.,"1980, 1983, 1981, 1986",Background | Personnel | Charts | Certifications | References,"B-side: ""Happy Birthday"" (sing along version, 7-inch)

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariam_Sankara,Mariam Sankara,Thomas Sankara Burkina Faso,"Mariam Sankara (French pronunciation: [sɑ̃kaʁa], née Sereme, born 26 March 1953) is the widow of Thomas Sankara, the President of Burkina Faso (previously named Upper Volta) from 4 August 1983 until his assassination on 15 October 1987. During this time, she was First Lady of the country. Thomas Sankara, a Marxist and pan-Africanist army officer, became President of what was then known as the Republic of Upper Volta after a military coup in August 1983. He carried out what he proclaimed to be, the ""Democratic and Popular Revolution"" (French: Révolution démocratique et populaire), implementing many radical reforms. Sankara was killed in a coup in October 1987, orchestrated by his former friend and colleague Blaise Compaoré. As a result of the coup, Mariam Sankara was forced to flee Burkina Faso along with her two children. She went into exile in France, where she would spend the next twenty years. Meanwhile, she was replaced as First Lady by Chantal Compaoré. In 1997 she filed a complaint to a Burkinabé court regarding the murder of Thomas, but it wasn't until 28 June 2012 that the Supreme Court ruled that the case could be prosecuted under local jurisprudence. With the gradual opening up of the country's military regime, Sankara was eventually able to return to her home country in 2007, to attend commemorations held in honour of the 20-year anniversary of her husband's death. Large crowds greeted her return to the capital Ouagadougou. In late October 2014, a large-scale uprising broke out in Burkina Faso, protesting President Blaise Compaoré's attempts to prolong his 27-year rule. As a result of the protests, partially inspired by the memory of Thomas Sankara, Compaoré was forced to resign and fled to the Ivory Coast. In response to this uprising, Mariam Sankara issued a statement congratulating the Burkinabé people for their victory, and calling for Compaoré to be prosecuted for his crimes against the people. She ended the letter by stating: ""Long live the Republic and long live Burkina! The motherland or death, we shall overcome."" In October 2021, the trial of the alleged perpetrators of Thomas Sankara's assassination began. Mariam Sankara was present at this trial.",1953 births | Living people | First ladies of Burkina Faso | 21st-century Burkinabe people,"1987, 1983, 1953, 2014, 1997, 2021, 2007, 2012",References,President: Thomas Sankara | Succeeded by: Chantal Compaoré,2206,2025-06-22 19:39:56

After being appointed Prime Minister in 1983, disputes with the sitting government resulted in Sankara's eventual imprisonment. While he was under house arrest, a group of revolutionaries seized power on his behalf in a popularly supported coup later that year. At the age of 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta and launched an unprecedented series of social, ecological, and economic reforms. In 1984, Sankara oversaw the renaming of the country as Burkina Faso ('land of the upright people'), and personally wrote its national anthem. His foreign policy was centered on anti-imperialism and he rejected loans and capital from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. However, he welcomed some foreign aid in an effort to boost the domestic economy, diversify the sources of assistance, and make Burkina Faso self-sufficient. His domestic policies included famine prevention, agrarian expansion, land reform, and suspending rural poll taxes, as well as a nationwide literacy campaign and vaccination program to reduce meningitis, yellow fever and measles. Sankara's health programmes distributed millions of doses of vaccines to children across Burkina Faso. His government also focused on building schools, health centres, water reservoirs, and infrastructure projects. He combatted desertification of the Sahel by planting more than 10 million trees. Socially, his government enforced the prohibition of female circumcision, forced marriages and polygamy. Sankara reinforced his populist image by ordering the sale of luxury vehicles and properties owned by the government in order to reduce costs. In addition, he banned what he considered the luxury of air conditioning in government offices, and homes of politicians. He established Cuban-inspired Committees for the Defense of the Revolution to serve as a new foundation of society and promote popular mobilization. His Popular Revolutionary Tribunals prosecuted public officials charged with graft, political crimes and corruption, considering such elements of the state counter-revolutionaries. This led to criticism by Amnesty International for alleged human rights violations, such as ",Sankarism | 1949 births | 1987 deaths | 1987 murders in Africa | African Marxists | African politicians assassinated in the 1980s | Anti-French sentiment | Anti-imperialists,"1983, 1949, 1987, 1984",Early life | Military career | Government posts | Presidency | Council of the Revolution | Healthcare and public works | Agriculture | Environment,Prime Minister: Vacant | Preceded by: Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo (as President of Upper Volta) | Succeeded by: Blaise Compaoré,2544,2025-06-22 19:39:57

The flag was adopted on 4 August 1984. The flag uses the Pan-African colours of Ethiopia, reflecting both a break with the country's colonial past and its unity with other African ex-colonies. The red is also said to symbolize the revolution and the green the abundance of agricultural and natural riches. The yellow star placed over the red and green stripes represents the guiding light of the revolution. The flag was adopted following the coup of 1983 which brought Thomas Sankara to power. The original flag of Upper Volta, adopted at independence, contained three horizontal stripes of black, white, and red. These colours represented the three major tributaries of the Volta River, which flows south through the country: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta. It is identical to the tricolor flag used by the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. The flag was changed when Upper Volta became Burkina Faso on 4 August 1984.

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall,Thurgood Marshall,Thurgood Marshall,"Thoroughgood ""Thurgood"" Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American civil rights lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1967 until 1991. He was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Prior to his judicial service, he was an attorney who fought for civil rights, leading the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Marshall was a prominent figure in the movement to end racial segregation in American public schools. He won 29 of the 32 civil rights cases he argued before the Supreme Court, culminating in the Court's landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which rejected the separate but equal doctrine and held segregation in public education to be unconstitutional. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court in 1967. A staunch liberal, he frequently dissented as the Court became increasingly conservative. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall attended Lincoln University and the Howard University School of Law. At Howard, he was mentored by Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught his students to be ""social engineers"" willing to use the law to fight for civil rights. Marshall opened a law practice in Baltimore but soon joined Houston at the NAACP in New York. They worked together on the segregation case of Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada; after Houston returned to Washington, Marshall took his place as special counsel of the NAACP, and he became director-counsel of the newly formed NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He participated in numerous landmark Supreme Court cases involving civil rights, including Smith v. Allwright, Morgan v. Virginia, Shelley v. Kraemer, McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, Sweatt v. Painter, Brown, and Cooper v. Aaron. His approach to desegregation cases emphasized the use of sociological data to show that segregation was inherently unequal. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he favored a broad interpretation of constitutional protections. Four years later, Johnson appointed him as the U.S. Solicitor General. In 1967, Johnson nominated Marshall to replace Justice Tom C. Clark on the Supreme Court; despite opposition from Southern senators, he was confirmed by a vote of 69 to 11. He was often in the majority during the consistently liberal Warren Court period, but after appointments by President Richard Nixon made the Court mo",Thurgood Marshall | 1908 births | 1993 deaths | 20th-century African-American lawyers | 20th-century American lawyers | Activists for African-American civil rights | African-American Episcopalians | American Episcopalians,"1967, 1991, 1993, 1961, 1954, 1908",Early life and education | Legal career | Court of Appeals | Solicitor General | Supreme Court nomination | Supreme Court | Equal protection and civil rights | Criminal procedure and capital punishment,Appointed by: Lyndon B.

The college, named after Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice and lawyer for the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, emphasizes ""scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of [one's] role in society."" Marshall College's general education requirements emphasize the culture of community involvement and multiculturalism; accordingly Marshall houses the minors in Public Service and Film Studies for the campus. Significant academic programs and departments have come out of the college over many decades: Communication, Ethnic Studies, Third World Studies, African American Studies, Urban Studies & Planning, and Education Studies. Founded as Third College in 1970 amid the student activism of the period, TMC's original aim was to help students understand their own community through a critical examination of diversity and community in the United States. Marshall College's required writing program is called Dimensions of Culture (DOC), and is a 3 quarter (1 year) sequence that explores race, identity, imagination, tradition, and the law in the United States. During President Obama's administration, the White House honored UC San Diego and Marshall College's Public Service minor and charter school outreach as exemplary community service institutions serving the United States. In November 1965, the College III Preliminary Planning Committee released the first substantial report on what form UCSD's third college would take. The committee, comprising faculty members George Backus, Henry Booker, Gabriel Jackson, C.D. Keeling, and committee chair Andrew Wright, suggested that College III should focus itself on history and theory. The Wright Committee report suggested that the college have a muse—namely Clio, the Greek muse of history. History was chosen by the committee because it mixed humanism with science—College III would be a sort of ""common ground"" between the science of Revelle and the humanities of Muir. In a quiet act of rebelliousness (or perhaps it was just individuality), the committee planned that College III students would only have to take three courses per quarter to graduate in four years, as opposed to the four it took at the other UCSD colleges.

During his life, Louverture first fought and allied with Spanish forces against Saint-Domingue Royalists, then joined with Republican France, becoming Governor-General-for-life of Saint-Domingue, and lastly fought against Bonaparte's republican troops. As a revolutionary leader, Louverture displayed military and political acumen that helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. Along with Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Louverture is now known as one of the ""Fathers of Haiti"". Toussaint Louverture was born as a slave in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as Haiti. He was a devout Catholic, and was manumitted as an affranchi (ex-slave) before the French Revolution, identifying as a Creole for the greater part of his life. During his time as an affranchi, he became a salaried employee, an overseer of his former master's plantation, and later became a wealthy slave owner himself; Toussaint Louverture owned several coffee plantations at Petit Cormier, Grande Rivière, and Ennery. At the start of the Haitian revolution he was nearly 50 years old and began his military career as a lieutenant to Georges Biassou, an early leader of the 1791 War for Freedom in Saint-Domingue. Initially allied with the Spaniards of neighboring Santo Domingo, Louverture switched his allegiance to the French when the new Republican government abolished slavery. Louverture gradually established control over the whole island and used his political and military influence to gain dominance over his rivals. Throughout his years in power, he worked to balance the economy and security of Saint-Domingue. Worried about the economy, which had stalled, he restored the plantation system using paid labor; negotiated trade agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States and maintained a large and well-trained army. Louverture seized power in Saint-Domingue, established his own system of government, and promulgated his own colonial constitution in 1801 that named him as Governor-General for Life, which challenged Napoleon Bonaparte's authority. In 1802, he was invited to a parley by French Divisional General Jean-Baptiste Brunet, but was arrested upon his arrival.

The airport is currently the busiest in Haiti and is an operating hub for Sunrise Airways. It is informally called ""the Maïs-Gâté airport"", named after the area in the Cul-de-Sac Plain where the airport was built. During the United States occupation of Haiti the United States Marine Corps stationed Marine Observation units using HS-1 and HS-2 aircraft in what later became Bowen Field (c. 1919). In 1942, the USMC was sent to Haiti to build a facility to service Douglas O-38 aircraft used by Haiti Air Corps to observe Nazi German activity in the region. The USMC built Bowen Field (also known as Chancerelles Airport), a small civilian and military airport located near Chancerelles area near the Baie de Port-au-Prince. Bowen Field was used by Haiti Air Corps for mail (1943) and passenger (1944) services, then succeeded by the Compagnie haïtienne de transports aériens beginning in 1961. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it served as an airbase for the US military in Haiti. The current airport located further northeast of Bowen Field was developed with grant money from the US government and mostly money collected from Haitian people (taxes, lottery, etc.), opened as François Duvalier International Airport in 1965, after the Haitian president at the time, François ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier.[citation needed] The old Bowen field was decommissioned after 1994 and is now hosts Internally Displaced Persons Camp and Centre Sportif. The runway is now part of Avenue Haile Selassie.[citation needed] Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude Duvalier, resigned in 1986. The airport was renamed Port-au-Prince International Airport. Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide renamed the airport again as Toussaint Louverture International Airport in 2003 to honor Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution.[citation needed]",Airports in Haiti | Buildings and structures in Port-au-Prince | 2010 Haiti earthquake relief | Airports established in 1965 | 1965 establishments in Haiti,"1965, 1994, 1919, 1961, 2003, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1986",History | Foundation and early years | Development since the 2000s | Facilities | Terminal | Expansion | Airlines and destinations | Passenger,Airport type: Public | Owner: Office National de l'Aviation Civile | Operator: Autorité Aéroportuaire Nationale,2087,2025-06-22 19:33:42

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago,Culture of Trinidad and Tobago,Trinidad Tobago culture,"The culture of Trinidad and Tobago reflects the influence of Indian-South Asian, African, Indigenous, European, Chinese, North American, Latino, and Arab cultures. The histories of Trinidad and Tobago are different. There are differences in the cultural influences which have shaped each island. Trinidad and Tobago is an English-speaking country with strong links to the United Kingdom. Historical membership in the British Empire left a major influence on the country, including the differences of the English language and the popularity of the two top sports in the country, football, and cricket. The most influential single cultural factor in Trinidad and Tobago is Carnival, brought to Trinidad by French settlers from Martinique in the later part of the 18th century. Originally the celebration was confined to the elite, but it was imitated and adapted by their African slaves and, after the abolition of slavery in 1838, the practice spread into the free population. The Canboulay Riots of 1881 were a turning point in the evolution of Trinidad Carnival. Carnival was originally confined to the upper classes, which rode the streets in floats, or watched from the upper stories of residences and businesses. The night was given over to the lower classes. The first few hours of Carnival Monday morning, from about 4 am until sunrise was known as J'ouvert (a contraction of jour ouvert). Costumed and masked by the darkness, J'ouvert allowed the wealthy to mix with the poor in relative anonymity. Monday night (night 'mas) had a similar, but lesser function. The daytime of Carnival Monday and Tuesday are dominated by costumed masqueraders. Until World War II, most of these masqueraders portrayed traditional African influenced characters including the Midnight Robber, Police and Thief, Wild-American Indian, Bat', and Jab Mola individuals gave way to organized bands, which today can include thousands of masqueraders. Peter Minshall is often considered the greatest mas' designer.[why?] Carnival takes place most heatedly during the week before the actual parade of bands on Carnival Monday and Tuesday. However, traditionally, the Carnival season begins on Boxing Day December 26 and soca and calypso music reign supreme over the airwaves. The fetes that take place from year end through carnival (usually in February) are generally carnival-themed and feature live music from bands and soca artists who are promoting their song contributions for the year.",Culture of Trinidad and Tobago,"1881, 1838",Festivals | Carnival | Christmas | Divali | Hosay | Phagwah | Maha Shivratri | Music,,2471,2025-06-22 19:34:27
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago,Trinidad and Tobago,Trinidad Tobago culture,"Trinidad and Tobago,[a] officially the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, is the southernmost island country in the Caribbean, comprising the main islands of Trinidad and Tobago, along with several smaller islets. The capital city is Port of Spain, while its largest and most populous municipality is Chaguanas. Despite its proximity to South America, Trinidad and Tobago is generally considered to be part of the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago is located 11 kilometres (6 nautical miles) northeast off the coast of Venezuela, 130 kilometres (70 nautical miles) south of Grenada, and 288 kilometres (155 nautical miles) southwest of Barbados. Indigenous peoples inhabited Trinidad for centuries prior to Spanish colonization, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498. Spanish governor José María Chacón surrendered the island to a British fleet under Sir Ralph Abercromby's command in 1797. Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889. Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962, and became a republic in 1976. Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories, which rely heavily on tourism, the economy is primarily industrial, based on large reserves of oil and gas. The country experiences fewer hurricanes than most of the Caribbean because it is farther south. Trinidad and Tobago is well known for its African and Indian caribbean cultures, reflected in its large and famous Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, Hosay, and Diwali celebrations, as well as being the birthplace of the steelpan, the limbo, and musical styles such as calypso, soca, rapso, parang, chutney, and chutney soca.",1960s establishments in the Caribbean | 1962 establishments in Trinidad and Tobago | Countries and territories where English is an official language | Countries in North America | Countries in the Caribbean | Former British colonies and protectorates in the Americas | Former Spanish colonies | Island countries,"1976, 1889, 1962, 1797, 1802, 1498",Toponymy | History | Geological history | Indigenous peoples | European colonization | British rule | Contemporary era | Geography,Capital: Port of Spain10°40′01″N 61°30′27″W﻿ / ﻿10.667°N 61.5075°W﻿ / 10.667; -61.5075 | Largest city: Chaguanas 10°31′N 61°24′W﻿ / ﻿10.517°N 61.400°W﻿ / 10.517; -61.400 | Official languages: English[1],1673,2025-06-22 19:34:29
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_Carnival,Trinidad and Tobago Carnival,Trinidad Tobago culture,"The Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is an annual holiday held on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in Trinidad and Tobago. This event is well known for participants’ colorful costumes and exuberant celebrations, with a unique blend of Afro and Indo-Trinidadian traditions. The fusion of these cultural influences is evident in the music, dance, and costumes, creating a vibrant and diverse celebration that represents the rich heritage of Trinidad and Tobago. There are numerous cultural events such as ""band launch"" fetes running in the lead up to the street parade on Carnival Monday and Tuesday. Traditionally, the festival is associated with calypso music, developed by Afro-Trinidadians in 17th century Trinidad; however, Soca music has begun to replace calypso as the more popular musical genre for Carnival. Costume (sometimes called ""mas""), stick-fighting, limbo, and steelpan competitions are important components of the festival. Carnival, as it is celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago, has spread to many other Caribbean islands as well as several cities worldwide. These celebrations include Toronto's Caribana, Miami's Miami Carnival, Houston Carifest, London's Notting Hill Carnival, as well as New York City's Labor Day Carnival. The annual Carnival in Trinidad dates back to the 1780s, when an influx of immigrants from the French West Indies emigrated to Trinidad in response to the Cédula de Población. These immigrants included French planters and 'free coloureds' (free people of mixed race), as well as enslaved Africans. The Mas tradition started in the late 18th century with French plantation owners organizing masquerades (mas) and balls before enduring the fasting of Lent. Enslaved Africans, who could not take part in Carnival. They are said to have staged their own mini-carnivals, but using their own rituals and folklore and imitating or mocking their masters' masquerade balls. Enslaved Africans also formed parallel celebration called ""Canboulay"". Canboulay (from the French cannes brulés, meaning burnt cane) The festival was characterized by drums, singing, calinda dancing, chanting, and stick-fighting. Canboulay is considered is a precursor to Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, and has played an important role in the development of the music of Trinidad and Tobago. Calypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African Kaiso and canboulay music brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantation",Culture of Trinidad and Tobago | Music festivals in the Caribbean | Annual events in Trinidad and Tobago | Carnivals in Trinidad and Tobago | Winter in Trinidad and Tobago | Folk festivals in Trinidad and Tobago,,Origin | Carnival dates | Characters | References | External links,"Observed by: Trinidad and Tobago | Type: Cultural | Significance: Week before Lent | Celebrations: processions, music, dancing, and the use of masquerade | Date: Monday and Tuesday before Lent | Frequency: Annual",3170,2025-06-22 19:34:29

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago,Hinduism in Trinidad and Tobago,Trinidad Tobago culture,"Hinduism in Trinidad and Tobago is the second largest religion. Hindu culture arrived to Trinidad and Tobago in 1845, with the arrival of the first Indian indentured laborers, the overwhelming majority of which were Hindu. According to the 2011 census there were 240,100 declared Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago. A decade after slavery was abolished in 1834, the British government gave permission for the colonists to import indentured labor from India to work on the estates. Throughout the remainder of the century, Trinidad's population growth came primarily from Indian laborers. By 1871, there were 27,425 Indians, approximately 22 percent of the population of Trinidad and Tobago; by 1911 that figure had grown to 110,911, or about 33 percent of all residents of the islands. During the initial decades of Indian indenture, Indian cultural forms were met with either contempt or indifference by the non-Hindu majority. Hindus have made many contributions to Trinidad history and culture even though the state historically regarded Hindus as second class citizens. Hindus in Trinidad struggled over the granting of adult franchise, the Hindu marriage bill, the divorce bill, cremation ordinance, and others. Cremation was allowed in 1953. There has been persistent discontent among the Hindus with their marginalization. Many groups portray Hindus as ""clannish, backward and miserly"". During the General Elections of 1986, the absence of the Bhagvad Gita and the Quran at polling stations for required oath-taking was interpreted as a gross insult to Hindus and Muslims. The absence of any Hindu religious texts at the official residence of the President of Trinidad and Tobago during the swearing in of the new Government in 1986 was perceived as another insult to the minority communities since they were represented in the government. The national education system and curriculum have been repeatedly accused of such majority-oriented symbolism. The use of discernibly oriented prayers at Government schools, the non-representation of Hinduism in approved school textbooks, and the lack of emphasis on Hindu religious observance evoked deep resentment from the Hindu community. Intensified protests over the course of the 1980s led to an improvement in the state's attitudes towards Hindus.",Hinduism in Trinidad and Tobago | Indo-Caribbean religion | Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian culture,"1834, 2011, 1911, 1953, 1871, 1986, 1845","History | Demographics | Sects, denominations, and organizations | Culture | Mandirs | Hindu organisations and holidays | Caste | Cremation",,2297,2025-06-22 19:34:31

Academics regard him as one of the most influential music artists of the 20th century and a prominent political activist for Black America. In addition to his music career, Shakur also wrote poetry and starred in films. He is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. His lyrical content has been noted for addressing social injustice, political issues, and the marginalization of other African-Americans, but he was also synonymous with gangsta rap and violent lyrics. Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his conscious rap and political rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial multi-platinum success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995). His Diamond certified album All Eyez on Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur starred roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). Shakur's most notable songs include ""California Love"", ""Changes"", ""Dear Mama"", ""Hail Mary"", ""Keep Ya Head Up"", ""Hit 'Em Up"", ""Ambitionz az a Ridah"", ""All Eyez on Me"", ""Ghetto Gospel"", ""Do for Love"", ""So Many Tears"", ""To Live & Die in L.A."", ""How Do U Want It"", ""2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted"", ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" and ""I Get Around"". Alongside his solo career, Shakur was part of the group Thug Life and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Outlawz. During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration.

Shakur was the mother of rapper Tupac Shakur and the executor of his estate. She founded the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation and was the CEO of Amaru Entertainment, Inc., a record and film production company she founded. On May 2, 2016, Shakur died at a hospital in California. Afeni Shakur was born Alice Williams on January 10, 1947, in Lumberton, North Carolina. She had an older sister, Gloria ""Glo"" Jean. At the age of eleven in 1958, Williams and her sister moved to the South Bronx with their mother, a factory worker. Williams attended Benjamin Franklin Junior High School in the Bronx, where she demonstrated above average reading ability and her grades qualified her for honors. She wrote for the school newspaper, The Franklin Flash, and in the ninth grade, won a journalism award for which she received congratulations from Mayor Robert F. Wagner. In 1962, Williams passed the qualifying examinations for the Bronx High School of Science and High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. She chose the latter because she felt performers and actors were free spirited. However, Williams could not afford the school supplies and she felt like an outcast at the school, so she dropped out after one term. She began drifting and became a member of a Bronx street gang called the Disciples. She briefly worked a postal job, becoming one of the first woman mail carriers in New York.","1947 births | 2016 deaths | People from Lumberton, North Carolina | Members of the Black Panther Party | Shakur family | African-American activists | Activists from North Carolina | 21st-century American women","1947, 1962, 1958, 2016",Early life | Activism | The Panther 21 | Bedford Hill Correctional Facility | Later life and death | Estate of Tupac Shakur | See also | References,"Born: Alice Faye Williams(1947-01-10)January 10, 1947Lumberton, North Carolina, U.S. | Died: May 2, 2016(2016-05-02) (aged 69)Sausalito, California, U.S. | Occupation: Activist | Years active: 1968–1971 | Political party: Black Panther | Spouses: Lumumba Shakur

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_(Tupac_Shakur_song),Changes (Tupac Shakur song),Tupac Shakur,"""Changes"" is a song by American rapper 2Pac. It was recorded in 1992 before being remixed and released as a single from Shakur's Greatest Hits compilation on October 13, 1998. The song features Talent, an R&B trio from Kansas City consisting of Marlon ""Castor Troy"" Hatcher, Keith ""Casino"" Murrell and Ernest ""Bishop"" Dixon that was active from 1998 to 2005. The song makes references to the many wars in the Middle East, the war on drugs, the treatment of black people by the police, racism, the reconciliation between the black and white people in America, the perpetuation of poverty and its accompanying vicious-cycle value system in urban African American culture, and the difficulties of life in the ghetto. ""Changes"" samples Bruce Hornsby and the Range's 1986 song ""The Way It Is"". The chorus was sung by Talent. ""Changes"" received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 2000 Grammy Awards, making it the only posthumous song to be nominated in this category. The song is widely regarded as one of Shakur's greatest songs, as well as one of the greatest rap songs of all time. In 2017, Consequence ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Tupac Shakur songs. The song was originally recorded during his tenure at Interscope Records in 1992 and was produced by Big D The Impossible (Deon Evans). ""Changes"" was later remixed in 1998 by Poke from Trackmasters. The song re-uses lines from ""I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto"" which was recorded during the same year, and samples the 1986 hit ""The Way It Is"" by Bruce Hornsby and the Range. The chorus of ""The Way It Is"" was slightly reworded and sung by Talent and was used for this song. At times Tupac re-used lines from other unreleased songs because he planned to make an updated version at a later date. However, since his death many of the unreleased and unmastered songs have been officially released. The remixed version released in 1998 has notably different percussion, and a few minor changes to the musical elements. The chorus on the original track features a notable difference in a vocal sample of the line, ""It's like that and that's the way it is"", from Run DMC's ""It's Like That"", which is also played twice during the intro. The second chorus adds the Ice Cube line, ""Dope dealers, you're as bad as the police"", from his song, ""Us"". The third chorus omits the Ice Cube sample and adds B-boy-style chant with an unknown person repeating, ""Clap your hands and feel it, clap your hands and feel it!"" unt",1992 songs | 1998 singles | Tupac Shakur songs | Interscope Records singles | Death Row Records singles | Songs released posthumously | Dutch Top 40 number-one singles | Number-one singles in Norway,"2005, 2017, 1998, 1992, 2000, 1986",Production and recording | Samples | Overview | Critical reception | Accolades | Charts | Weekly charts | Year-end charts,"Released: October 13, 1998 (1998-10-13) | Recorded: 1992

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad,Underground Railroad,Underground Railroad,"The Underground Railroad was an organized network of secret routes and safe houses used by fugitive slaves to escape to the abolitionist Northern United States and Eastern Canada prior to the 1865 abolition of slavery in the United States. Enslaved Africans and African Americans escaped from slavery as early as the 16th century and many of their escapes were unaided. However, a network of safe houses generally known as the Underground Railroad began to organize in the 1780s among Abolitionist Societies in the North. It ran north and grew steadily until the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln. The escapees sought primarily to escape into free states, and potentially from there to Canada. The Underground Railroad started at the place of enslavement. The routes followed natural and man-made modes of transportation - rivers, canals, bays, the Atlantic Coast, ferries and river crossings, road and trails. Locations close to ports, free territories and international boundaries prompted many escapes. As research continues, new routes are discovered and will be represented on the map. The network, primarily the work of free and enslaved African Americans, was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. The enslaved people who risked capture and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the passengers and conductors of the Railroad, respectively. Various other routes led to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished, and to islands in the Caribbean that were not part of the slave trade. An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763–1783), existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. During the American Civil War, freedom seekers escaped to Union lines in the South to obtain their freedom. One estimate suggests that by 1850, approximately 100,000 slaves had escaped to freedom via the network. According to former professor of Pan-African studies J. Blaine Hudson, who was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Louisville, by the end of the Civil War, 500,000 or more African Americans self-emancipated from slavery on the Underground Railroad. Eric Foner wrote that the term ""was perhaps first used by a Washington newspaper in 1839, quoting a young slave hoping to escape bondage via a railroad that 'went underground all the way to Boston'"".

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Underground_Railroad_(novel),The Underground Railroad (novel),Underground Railroad,"The Underground Railroad is a historical fiction novel by American author Colson Whitehead, published by Doubleday in 2016. The alternate history novel tells the story of Cora, a slave in the Antebellum South during the 19th century, who makes a bid for freedom from her Georgia plantation by following the Underground Railroad, which the novel depicts as an actual rail transport system with safe houses and secret routes. The book was a critical and commercial success, hitting the bestseller lists and winning several literary awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the National Book Award for Fiction, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the 2017 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence. A TV miniseries adaptation, written and directed by Barry Jenkins, was released in May 2021. The book alternates between the perspective of the lead character, Cora, and chapters told from a different character's perspective. The featured characters are: Ajarry, Cora's grandmother; Ridgeway, a slave catcher; Stevens, a South Carolina doctor conducting a social experiment; Ethel, the wife of a North Carolina station agent; Caesar, a fellow enslaved person who escapes the plantation with Cora; and Mabel, Cora's mother. The chapter locations are: Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana, and (an undefined) ""North"". Cora is an enslaved person on a plantation in Georgia and an outcast after her mother, Mabel, ran off without her. She resents Mabel for escaping, although it is later revealed that her mother tried to return to Cora but died from a snake bite and never reached her. Caesar approaches Cora about a plan to flee. Reluctant at first, she eventually agrees as her situation with her master and fellow slaves worsens. During their escape, they encounter a group of slave catchers, who capture Cora's young friend Lovey. Cora is forced to kill a twelve-year-old boy to protect herself and Caesar, eliminating any possibility of merciful treatment should she be recaptured. With the help of an inexperienced abolitionist, Cora and Caesar find the Underground Railroad, depicted as a literal underground train system that runs throughout the south, transporting runaways northwards. They take a train to South Carolina. Upon learning of their escape, Ridgeway begins a hunt for the pair, mainly in revenge for Mabel, who is the only escapee he has ever failed to capture. Cora and Caesar have taken up comfortable residence in South Carolina under assumed names.

Du Bois,"William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (/duːˈbɔɪs/ doo-BOYSS; February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American sociologist, socialist, historian, and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist. Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community. After completing graduate work at Harvard University, where he was the first African American to earn a doctorate, Du Bois rose to national prominence as a leader of the Niagara Movement, a group of black civil rights activists seeking equal rights. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta Compromise. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the talented tenth, a concept under the umbrella of racial uplift, and believed that African Americans needed the chance for advanced education to develop their leadership. Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. Du Bois used his position in the NAACP to respond to racist incidents. After the First World War, he attended the Pan-African Congresses, embraced socialism and became a professor at Atlanta University. Once the Second World War had ended, he engaged in peace activism and was targeted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He spent the last years of his life in Ghana and died in Accra on August 27, 1963. Du Bois was a prolific author. He primarily targeted racism with his writing, which protested strongly against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and racial discrimination in important social institutions. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several meetings of the Pan-African Congress to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers. Du Bois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. His collection of essays, The Souls of Black Folk, is a seminal work in African-American literature; and his 1935 magnum opus, Black Reconstruction in America, challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction era. Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized the use of the term color line to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life.

Du Bois,"Nina Yolande Du Bois (October 21, 1900 – March 1961), known as Yolande Du Bois, was an American teacher known for her involvement in the Harlem Renaissance. She was the daughter of W.E.B. Du Bois and the former Nina Gomer. Her father encouraged her marriage to Countee Cullen, a nationally known poet of the Harlem Renaissance. They divorced within two years. She married again and had a daughter, Du Bois's only grandchild. That marriage also ended in divorce. Du Bois graduated from Fisk University and later earned an MA from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, primarily in Baltimore, Maryland. Du Bois was born on October 21, 1900, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, her father's hometown, to William Edward Burghardt and Nina (née Gomer) Du Bois. They had arrived there from Atlanta, Georgia, shortly after the death of their infant son Burghardt from diphtheria in 1899. When Yolande was growing up, she did not have a close relationship with her father. He was often away for his career, or living in a different city altogether for academic research and assignments. Yolande was often ill. A family physician diagnosed the girl as having ""inadequate levels of lime"" when she had poor health. Some biographers thought that Yolande faked these illnesses to gain her father's attention. As a child, Yolande was defiant toward her parents. She was aggressive and passionate in nature. Her father described their relationship as one in which she held the power. To gain some control, her parents sent her to Bedales, a British boarding school. While dealing with racial discrimination, she graduated from Brooklyn's Girls' High School. Du Bois began attending Fisk University in 1920. In her sophomore year she fell ill, and spent the entire month of February in the hospital due to serious inflammation of the gums. While in college, Yolande was in a loving romance with jazz musician Jimmie Lunceford. However, her father believed he was an unsuitable match. Defying her parents' wishes, she continued to see Lunceford for some time. The relationship ended when she conceded to her father's wish that she marry poet Countee Cullen, who had received early acclaim in his career. She graduated from Fisk and started teaching in Baltimore, Maryland at a public high school.","1900 births | 1961 deaths | Harlem Renaissance | Fisk University alumni | Educators from Atlanta | Du Bois family | People educated at Bedales School | Teachers College, Columbia University alumni","1900, 1899, 1920, 1961",Early life | Marriage and family | Later adulthood | Career as teacher and later life | References,"Born: (1900-10-21)October 21, 1900Great Barrington, Massachusetts, U.S. | Died: March 1961 (aged 60) | Occupation: Educator | Spouse(s): Countee Cullen (divorced)Arnette Franklin Williams (divorced) | Children: 1 | Parent(s): W.

Following her father's promotion to head cook of the hotel, he purchased a small house for the family in 1878. She attended Wilberforce University. She married the activist W.E.B. Du Bois, who had been a teacher at Wilberforce University, on May 12, 1896, at her father's home in Cedar Rapids. They had two children: a son, Burghardt, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Yolande. She lived in Baltimore with her daughter until her daughter's divorce, at which time the two moved to the family's Dunbar apartment in New York City. She was involved in her husband's civil rights work and described as a civil rights activist, but mostly stayed home to raise their daughter. She served on the executive committee of the Women's International Circle of Peace and Foreign Relations in 1927, alongside Minta Bosley Allen Trotman and Addie Waites Hunton. The committee was largely responsible for organizing the fourth Pan-African Congress in New York.",1870 births | 1950 deaths | 19th-century African-American women | 20th-century African-American women | 20th-century Bahá'ís | Activists for African-American civil rights | African-American Bahá'ís | American women civil rights activists,"1870, 1878, 1896, 1950, 1927",Early life and education | Later life | References,"Born: (1870-07-04)July 4, 1870Quincy, Illinois, U.S. | Died: July 26, 1950(1950-07-26) (aged 80)Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. | Resting place: Mahaiwe Cemetery | Education: Wilberforce University | Occupation(s): activisthomemaker | Spouse: W.E.B.

Du Bois is the 2021 debut novel by American poet Honorée Fanonne Jeffers. It explores the history of an African-American family in the American South, from the time before the American Civil War and slavery, through the Civil Rights Movement, to the present. Themes include family history, education, and racism, and the prose narrative is interspersed with poetic passages (""love songs"") that provide insight into and detail of the protagonist's ancestors, who are people of African, Creek, and Scottish descent. The novel covers multiple generations of an African-American family. The novel's protagonist is Ailey Pearl Garfield. While her grandmother wants her to follow the family tradition and become a medical doctor, she wants to be a historian. One of the novel's narrative strands follows her youth and education, and that development is interspersed with her research into her family's history, a story centered in the fictional town of Chicasetta, Georgia, where her family had been enslaved by Samuel Pinchard, a brutal white man who, in the run-up to the American Civil War, also raped the enslaved people. Throughout the novel, poetic passages (""love songs"") chronicle the lives of Ailey's ancestors, who are of African, Creek, and Scottish descent. There is a connection also with Washington, D.C., where Ailey was born, and where her parents moved after getting married; their love and marriage during the Civil rights movement is another narrative strand. In D.C., her father attended Mecca University, a fictionalized version of Howard University. Ailey continues to spend summers in Chicasetta, the geographical heart of the novel, even after leaving for ""the City"". Ailey attended an HBCU, and becomes close with her great-uncle ""Uncle Root"", a retired professor there. Also narrated is the story of Ailey's troubled sister, Lydia, whose promise was thwarted by sexual abuse and addiction. Black intellectual, sociologist and civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois (1868–1963), according to Jeffers, is present everywhere in the novel, as he was omnipresent for ""Black folks who grew up in all-Black spaces and went to HBCUs."" According to Lauren LeBlanc, ""his belief that Black people are capable of far more than white society expects is a running thread in the novel."" Epigrams from the novel come from Du Bois, and he appears in a story told by Uncle Root. Du Bois's concept of ""The Talented Tenth"" is reflected in Ailey's family and their potential a",2021 American novels | African-American novels | American historical novels | HarperCollins books | W.

Commonly referred to as ""the Voice"", she is one of the most awarded performers of all time. As a cultural icon, her chart achievements and music videos influenced the breaking down of gender and racial barriers. Known for her vocal delivery and live performances, Houston was ranked second on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest singers of all time in 2023. Houston signed to Arista Records at the age of 19. Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985) and Whitney (1987), topped the Billboard 200 for 14 and 11 weeks, respectively. The former remains the best selling debut album by a solo artist in history, while the latter made her the first woman to debut atop the US and UK charts. Houston took a more urban turn with her third album, I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990), and performed an acclaimed rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at Super Bowl XXV in 1991. She then starred in the films The Bodyguard (1992), Waiting to Exhale (1995), The Preacher's Wife (1996) and Cinderella (1997), and produced the film franchises The Princess Diaries (2001–2004) and The Cheetah Girls (2003–2006).

However, her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown tarnished her ""America's Sweetheart"" image, overshadowing her next album, Just Whitney (2002). After divorcing Brown, Houston returned to the top of the Billboard 200 with her final album, I Look to You (2009).

During her political career, she served as a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 2003, and from 2009 until her death, and was a deputy minister of arts and culture from 1994 to 1996. A member of the African National Congress (ANC) political party, she served on the ANC's National Executive Committee and headed its Women's League. Madikizela-Mandela was known to her supporters as the ""Mother of the Nation"". Born to a Xhosa royal family in Bizana, and a qualified social worker, she married anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg in 1958; they remained married for 38 years and had two children together. In 1963, after Mandela was imprisoned following the Rivonia Trial, she became his public face during the 27 years he spent in jail. During that period, she rose to prominence within the domestic anti-apartheid movement. Madikizela-Mandela was detained by apartheid state security services on various occasions, tortured, subjected to banning orders, and banished to a rural town, and she spent several months in solitary confinement. In the mid-1980s, Madikizela-Mandela exerted a ""reign of terror"", and was ""at the centre of an orgy of violence"" in Soweto, which led to condemnation by the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, and a rebuke by the ANC in exile. During this period, her home was burned down by residents of Soweto. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) established by Nelson Mandela's government to investigate human rights abuses found Madikizela-Mandela to have been ""politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the Mandela United Football Club"", her security detail. Madikizela-Mandela endorsed the necklacing of alleged police informers and apartheid government collaborators, and her security detail carried out kidnapping, torture, and murder, most notoriously the killing of 14-year-old Stompie Seipei whose kidnapping she was convicted of. Nelson Mandela was released from prison on 11 February 1990, and the couple separated in 1992; their divorce was finalised in March 1996. She visited him during his final illness.

The town serves the surrounding farms for supplies and amenities. It is well known for once being home to the anti-apartheid stalwart and wife of Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela, during her banishment. The town was established in 1866 on the farm Keerom, occupied by Jacobus van Motlogeloa who was a Voortrekker elder. The community was visited by the then Orange Free State President, Johannes Brand, and the settlement was named in his honour shortly afterwards. Brandfort was proclaimed a town in 1874. The British built a concentration camp here during the Second Anglo-Boer War to house Boer women and children as well as a separate camp for Blacks. Brandfort was also at one time home to former prime minister Hendrik Verwoerd, an architect of apartheid, who matriculated here. Concentration camps, derived from the Spanish word ""concentrade"", were first used in Cuba in 1896 by General Butcher Weyler. Half a million Cuban civilians were rounded up and incarcerated in fortified villages in which about 100 000 died. In South Africa, the first concentration camps were erected in early 1901 during the Anglo-Boer South African War (1899-1902), also known as the Second Boer War. Thousands of women and children were removed from their farms and towns to the concentration camps. Conditions in the concentration camps were poor due to overcrowding and inadequate supplies.

She is the sister-in-law of the King of eSwatini, Mswati III, and the daughter of Nelson Mandela and his former wife, Winnie Mandela. Zenani Mandela was born into a family of chieftains. Her father, Nelson, was a direct descendant of the holders of the kingship of the Thembu people and was himself the heir to the chieftaincy of Mvezo. His grandson, Zenani's nephew Mandla, eventually succeeded to the latter title. She was nearly born in prison, as Winnie Mandela was arrested close to her birth in 1959, and when she was four her father was sent to prison, where he would stay for the next 27 years. Not until 1974, when she was 15 years old and could visit him, did she know about the arrest. Mandela-Dlamini studied at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa and science at Boston University. It was there that she first met Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of Swaziland (an elder brother of the reigning monarch of Swaziland, Mswati III and of Queen Mantfombi of the Zulus), who was studying science at the same university.

The Yoruba are said to be religious people, but they are also pragmatic and tolerant about their religious differences. Whilst many profess the Yoruba school of thought; many more profess other faiths e.g. Christianity (Ẹsìn Ìgbàgbọ́), Islam (Ẹsìn Ìmàle) etc. The Ifá divination system is a religious practice that originated from the Yoruba people of Nigeria and Benin.It is believed to be a divination Oracle made up of large sets of sacred verses and stories called Odus. Priests known as Babalawos interpret the messages using the sacred divination oracle that creates a specific pattern when thrown. Yoruba law is the legal system of Yorubaland. It is quite intricate, each group and subgroup having a system that varies, but in general, government begins within the immediate family. The next level is the clan, or extended family, with its own head known as a Baálé. This chief will be subject to town chiefs, and these chiefs are usually themselves subject to their Oba, who may or may not be subject to another Oba himself. Most of what survived of this legal code has been assimilated into the customary laws of the sovereign nations that the Yoruba inhabit. Yoruba people traditionally speak the Yorùbá language, a member of the Niger–Congo language family.

Its homeland is in present-day Southwestern Nigeria and Southern Benin, which comprises the majority of the states of; Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Lagos and parts of Kogi in Nigeria, the Departments of; Collines, Oueme, Plateau in Benin, and the adjoining parts of central Togo, commonly known as Yorubaland (Yoruba: Ilẹ̀ Káàárọ̀-Oòjíire). It has become the largest indigenous African tradition / belief system in the world with several million adherents worldwide. It shares some parallels with the Vodun practised by the neighbouring Fon and Ewe peoples to its west and with the religion of the Edo people to its east. Yorùbá religion is the basis for several religions in the New World, notably Santería, Umbanda, Trinidad Orisha, and Candomblé. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Ìtàn (history), the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up the Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá name for the Yorùbá indigenous religion is Ìṣẹ̀ṣẹ, which also refers to the traditions and rituals that encompass Yorùbá culture. The term comes from a contraction of the words Ìṣẹ̀ (Ishɛ), meaning ""source/root origin"", and ìṣe (Ishe), meaning ""practice/tradition"" coming together to mean ""The original tradition""/""The tradition of antiquity"" as many of the practices, beliefs, traditions, and observances of the Yorùbá originate from the religious worship of Olodumare and the veneration of the Òrìṣà. According to Kola Abimbola, the Yorubas have evolved a robust cosmology. Nigerian Professor for Traditional African religions, Jacob K. Olupona, summarizes that central for the Yorùbá religion, and which all beings possess, is known as ""Àṣẹ"", which is ""the empowered word that must come to pass,"" the ""life force"" and ""energy"" that ""regulates all movement and activity in the universe"". Every thought and action of each person or being in Ayé (the physical realm) interact with the Supreme force, all other living things, including the Earth itself, as well as with Ọ̀run (the otherworld), in which gods, spirits and ancestors exist.

During the 1810s, Shaka established a standing army that consolidated rival clans and built a large following which ruled a wide expanse of Southern Africa that extended along the coast of the Indian Ocean from the Tugela River in the south to the Pongola River in the north. A bitter civil war in the mid-19th century erupted which culminated in the 1856 Battle of Ndondakusuka between the brothers Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. In 1879, a British force invaded Zululand, beginning the Anglo-Zulu War. After an initial Zulu victory at the Battle of Isandlwana in January, the British regrouped and defeated the Zulus in July during the Battle of Ulundi, ending the war. The area was absorbed into the Colony of Natal and later became part of the Union of South Africa. The current Zulu king is Misuzulu Sinqobile, who serves as the monarch of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. Shaka was the illegitimate son of Senzangakhona, Chief of the Zulus. He was born c.1787. He and his mother, Nandi, were exiled by Senzangakhona, and found refuge with the Mthethwa. Shaka fought as a warrior under Dingiswayo, leader of the Mthethwa Paramountcy. When Senzangakona died, Dingiswayo helped Shaka become king of the Zulu. After Dingiswayo's death at the hands of Zwide, king of the Ndwandwe, around 1816, Shaka assumed leadership of the entire Mthethwa alliance. Shaka's clan at first numbered no more than a few thousands, but eventually grew in size to 45,000 after absorbing neighbouring clans. His military reforms included new battle techniques, training, and tough discipline, as well as the replacement of long-throwing spears in exchange for the more effective short-stabbing spears.

One of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu, he ordered wide-reaching reforms that reorganized the military into a formidable force. King Shaka was born in the lunar month of uNtulikazi (July) in 1787, in Mthonjaneni, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The son of the Zulu King Senzankakhona kaJama, he was spurned as an illegitimate son. Shaka spent part of his childhood in his mother's settlements, where he was initiated into an ibutho lempi (fighting unit/regiment), serving as a warrior under Inkosi Dingiswayo. King Shaka refined the ibutho military system with the Mthethwa Paramountcy's support over the next several years. He forged alliances with his smaller neighbours to counter Ndwandwe raids from the north. The initial Zulu maneuvers were primarily defensive, as King Shaka preferred to apply pressure diplomatically, with an occasional strategic assassination. His reforms of local society built on existing structures. Although he preferred social and propagandistic political methods, he also engaged in several battles. King Shaka's reign coincided with the start of the Mfecane/Difaqane (""upheaval"" or ""crushing""), a period of devastating warfare and chaos in southern Africa between 1815 and 1840 that depopulated the region. His role in the Mfecane/Difaqane is controversial.
