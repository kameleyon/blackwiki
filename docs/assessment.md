   - Demo content that should be replaced with real data

4. **Deprecated Patterns**
   - Some components use older patterns that could be modernized
   - Inconsistent error handling approaches

### Code Quality Issues üîß

1. **TODO Comments**
   - Multiple TODO/FIXME comments throughout codebase
   - Incomplete error handling in several API routes
   - Missing authorization checks marked as TODO

2. **Inconsistent Patterns**
   - Mix of different state management approaches
   - Inconsistent API response formats
   - Variable naming conventions

3. **Dead Code**
   - Unused imports in various files
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Unreachable code paths

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete Core Search**: Implement full-text search with Elasticsearch or similar
2. **Fix Authentication**: Add email verification and password reset
3. **Implement Caching**: Properly integrate Redis for performance
4. **Add Email System**: Set up transactional email service
5. **Security Hardening**: Implement rate limiting and CSRF protection

### Short-term Goals

1. **Complete Review System**: Finish the article review workflow
2. **Real Data Integration**: Replace all mock data with real implementations
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve mobile experience and add PWA features
4. **Performance Tuning**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting
5. **Testing Suite**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Long-term Objectives

1. **AI Integration**: Implement fact-checking and content suggestions
2. **Internationalization**: Build proper i18n infrastructure
3. **Community Features**: Complete voting, governance, and moderation tools
4. **Analytics Platform**: Build comprehensive analytics for content and users
5. **API Documentation**: Create developer documentation for API

## Technical Debt

### High Priority

## Conclusion

AfroWiki shows significant progress with a solid foundation and many working features. The main challenges are:

1. **Incomplete implementations**: Many features are partially built but not fully functional
2. **Missing core features**: Search, email, and security features are critical gaps
3. **Technical debt**: Accumulated from rapid development needs cleanup

The application is well-architected and follows modern best practices, making it a good foundation for continued development. Priority should be given to completing core functionality before adding new features.

### Overall Assessment
- **Completeness**: 65%
- **Code Quality**: 75%
- **Feature Coverage**: 60%
