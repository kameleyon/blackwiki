AfroWiki Project Assessment & Roadmap
Based on my analysis of the codebase, AfroWiki is an AI-enhanced encyclopedia platform focused on Black history, culture, and knowledge. The project uses Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS, with features for user authentication, content management, and AI-powered fact-checking.
